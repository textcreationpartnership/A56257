            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:60718:4"/>
alſo to a Council inveſted with the Supream Adminiſtration of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Authority in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. If it were but only for that Advice given by our <hi>Author</hi> at the very beginning of his <hi>Appendix</hi> to young Lawyers, <hi>to wit,</hi> to take care, <hi>that under the Pretence of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Prerogatives of Princes, they ſhould not be prodigal of their Liberty and Property,</hi> and his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the Foundation of <hi>Civil Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> to be built upon the <hi>Common Conſent</hi> of mutual Defence againſt Violences; This alone, I ſay, might be a convincing Argument to any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byaſs'd Perſon, that his Aim was very remote from maintaining an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power in the State, The next thing laid to our <hi>Author</hi>'s Charge is, that he ſo entirely ſeparates the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion from the State, as not to have the leaſt Interference with one another; whereas the contrary is now
<pb facs="tcp:60718:5"/>

               </gap>s, and in the Commonwealth of the <hi>Jews</hi> (inſtituted by God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Direction) this Union was inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. It cannot be denied, but that the outward Form of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, eſpecially among the <hi>Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,</hi> is in a great meaſure, and in moſt places adapted to that of the <hi>State;</hi> it being evident, that moſt of the <hi>Monarchical States, Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> as moſt ſuitable with that Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, was never aboliſhed; as on the contrary, the ſame was quite extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Proteſtant Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths.</hi> This is moſt particularly obſervable among the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who, tho' all agreeing in Point of Doctrine, are nevertheleſs, ſo far different from one another in the Ceremonial Point, and outward Form of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that in outward Appearance, they ſeem'd to be ſo many ſeveral Churches. Thus in the two Northern
<pb facs="tcp:60718:5"/>
Kingdoms of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> the Epiſcopal Authority (tho' much diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its Revenues) is retained to this day; whereas in ſome Commonwealths in <hi>Germany,</hi> where the ſame Religion is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed, it is quite aboliſhed, and not the leaſt footſteps of Subordination of Prieſts to be met with. But this Objection is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily cleared, if we take into due Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it being the Intention of our <hi>Author</hi> to repreſent in thoſe places Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in its genuine and native Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, freed from all what is foreign to its true Genius, he did not think it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to clog it with any thing that was not an Eſſential part of it; eſpecially when his chief aim was to ſhew the real difference betwixt the Chriſtian and Jewiſh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There are alſo not a few, who prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted by a prepoſterous Zeal, have imputed to our Author a certain kind of <hi>Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm</hi> in Religion, for which, I can ſee no other Reaſon, than that they are diſſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Aſſertions againſt any thing that has the leaſt reſemblance of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the ſcore of Difference of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I am well ſatisfied, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons alledged by him, are ſo ſolid in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo exactly applied to this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that they cannot but be Convincing

I cannot but take notice here, that our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Modern Clergy has of late gain'd ſo peculiar a Character of following ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe footſteps of convincing ſuch as differ from them in Opinion, rather by ſtrength of Argument, than any forcible Means, that I do not know whether they are not preferrable in this Point, before any other in <hi>Europe.</hi> If any one queſtions th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>AMong all thoſe Queſtions, which have for many Ages paſt been Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among Chriſtians, this may be deem'd one of the Chiefeſt, which Treats of the Nature, Authority, and Power of the Church; and which of the ſeveral Chriſtian Sects ought moſt juſtly to claim the Title of the <hi>True Church.</hi> The <hi>Romanists</hi> keep this for their laſt Reſerve, when Engag'd with the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> That they Attribute the Name of the <hi>True Church</hi> only to themſelves, and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtigmatize all ſuch as are not of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, with the Names of rebellious Deſerters.

               </gap>eſides this, it is to be look'd upon as a Matter of the greateſt Conſequence, both in regard of the Chriſtian Church, and the Publick Safety in a State, to know exactly, what bounds ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the Prieſtly Order in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs; as likewiſe to determin, how far the Power of Sovereigns extends it ſelf in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Matters: For, if either of them tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs their Bounds, it muſt of neceſſity prove the Cauſe of great Abuſes, Diſturbances and Oppreſſions, both in Church and State.

And here lies the main difference betwixt that Care, which, we ought to have our Souls, and that of our Bodies; the latter of which, may be committed to the Management of others, who being to be Accountable for all Injuries, which may befall us under their Tuition, we are thereby freed from any Guilt againſt our ſelves.

As thoſe that live in the free State of Nature, are not Subject to any Human Power, So, in the ſame State, their Religion, having only a relation to God Almighty, unto whom alone they are bound to pay Reverence, it is free from all Human Force or Power; which, in this State of Natural Freedom, they may exerciſe, either according to the Dictates of Reaſon, or, according to Divine Revelation; and, according to the beſt of their Knowledge, may diſpoſe the outward Form of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worſhip, without being accountable to any body, but God Almighty<hi>:</hi> Neither can they be Controuled, or forced, rather to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God according to another's, than their own Opinion. But, if any body pretends to bring them over to his Side, he ought with ſuitable Arguments, to Convince them, how far he is in the Right, and they in the Wrong.

Wherefore, the Prieſtly Office was originally joined with the Paternal, in the antient Fathers of Families; and <hi>Abraham</hi> is commended both for a good Father, and a good Maſter of his Houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he inſtructed his Children in all manner of Piety, and himſelf Adminiſtred Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 19.</note> The like Commands were made to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, both in the Old and New Teſtament; and the Patriarch <hi>Jacob,</hi> removed the Idols out <note place="margin">Ge. 17. 20 Deut. 6. 7. 11. 19. Eph. 6. 4. Gen. 35. 1, 3, 4.</note> of his Family, not by Compulſion, but by Inſtructing thoſe of his Houſe in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God, who thereupon, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily ſurrendred thoſe Idols to his Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal. This part of the Paternal Office, like all the reſt, does ceaſe as ſoon as a Son, after leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Father's Houſe, comes to ſet up for himſelf, and conſequently becomes the Father of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60718:13"/>
a ſeparate Family, and enjoys the ſame Rights, which his Father had before over him. And, tho' perhaps in ſuch a Caſe a Father may ſtill retain the priviledge of giving ſome Paternal Admonitions to his Sons, yet ought the ſame to be look'd upon to reſemble in their Nature our laſt Will or Teſtament, which does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways imply properly a Command; but ought to be obſerved for its good Intentions ſake, and to ſhew a due Reverence to the Memory of a Father, never to be neglected by any, that will not at the ſame time profeſs themſelves guilty of Improbity.</p>

Out of what has been ſaid before, it <note place="margin">Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties were not Inſtituted for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſake.</note> is moſt evident, That Civil Governments were not erected for Religions ſake; or that Man did not enter into Civil Societies, that they might with more conveniency eſtabliſh, and exerciſe their Religion. For, ſince Religions Exerciſes could be performed as well by a few, as by a great Number; and in a ſmall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation as well, as in a great one, it was unneceſſary to erect ſeveral great Societies on that account: Beſides, that thoſe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted open violences againſt others, which was the firſt motive that obliged Men to enter into Societies for their mutual Defence, did not aim at the Religion of Mankind; but, to robb theſe that were weaker than themſelves of their Liberty, Life, and Fortunes. Neither does a Man's Probity and Piety receive the leaſt addition, by the Number of People, which join in their Devotion; For every one muſt be acceptable to God Almighty upon his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; neither is a Man always deem'd the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60718:14"/>
more pious, becauſe he lives among ſuch as are pious themſelves. Thoſe Patriarchs that liv'd before Civil Societies were erected, are no leſs Famous for their Piety, than thoſe that lived afterwards under a ſettled Government. From whence it is evident, That Religion is not an ingenious Invention of the firſt Founders of Commonwealths, but as antient as Humane Raceit ſelf; it being ſufficiently apparent, that Mankind did not enter into Civil Societies, till long after, being enforced thereunto, by great and weighty Reaſons; tho' at the ſame time, it cannot be deny'd, but that ſome have cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly abuſed Religion, for obtaining their Ends in the State; But, Religion in it ſelf conſidered, is not made ſubordinate to the State; or to be deem'd a proper Inſtrument to ſerve a States Turn, and to keep the People in Obedience. And, when Religion is called, <hi>Vinculum Societatis Civilis, The Cement of Civil Society,</hi> it muſt be taken in this Senſe; That if all Religion and Regard, which ought to be had to God's diſpleaſure, were aboliſhed, there would be no Tie left, ſtrong enough to oblige Mankind to a compliance with thoſe Laws and fundamental Conſtitutions, which are the original Foundation of all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths; And, that, without the fear of being accountable to God Almighty, no Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Power alone would be prevailing enough to bridle the Enormities of ſome ſtubborn and refractory Spirits.</p>

The more, becauſe Religion was not inſtituted for the obtaining of this mutual Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and as ſuch, do's not contribute any thing towards the maintaining of Civil Society. Religion ariſes from a much more noble Spring, than Civil Government; and more ſtrictly obliges Mankind, than any Civil Power; and therefore is unalterable in its Nature. Thus it would be not only uſeleſs, but imply a Contradiction; if a Man, who is to become a Subject to a Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſhould be obliged to ſwear Allegiance to his Sovereign, in theſe following Terms: <hi>I.

their Subjects, for refuſing to be obedient to their Commands, on this Account; ſuch an Act ought to be look'd upon, as illegal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and tyrannical. God has verified this by extraordinary Miracles: It was an abſurd and illegal Proceeding, when <hi>Darius,</hi> overperſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his Courtiers, who intended to lay a Trap for <hi>Daniel,</hi> iſſued out his Proclamation, That <hi>no body, for thirty Days ſhould ask a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition</hi>

For, if any one ſhould have prayed in publick againſt the King, it would been a quite different Caſe; and ſuch a one had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly received Puniſhment, as an Enemy to his Sovereign. Wherefore, <hi>Daniel</hi> did very well, in continuing his daily private Prayers, according to his former Cuſtom; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the King's impious and fooliſh Command; and, was, for this Reaſon, by an extraordinary Miracle, delivered out of the Lions Den. In the ſame manner did God preſerve <hi>Daniel</hi>'s three Companions in the midſt of the Flames, becauſe they refuſed to worſhip the Golden Image, according to the King's Command: Though, at the ſame time, <note place="margin">Dan. 3. 27, 28.</note> it is very probable, that this Image, ſet up by <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> was not intended to be worſhipped as a God; but only as a Sign or Emblem of that Eternal Being, which he would have to be Adored and Worſhipped by his Subjects. Certainly, <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> could not be ſo much beſides himſelf, as to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,

Religion is the ſtrongeſt Knot for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a true Union betwixt Sovereigns and their Subjects. (God being a God of Truth, who has commanded, that Faith and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts ſhould be ſacred among Men:) It is therefore a Duty incumbent upon Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns, to take not only effectual Care, that Natural Religion be maintain'd, and cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among their Subjects; But they have alſo a ſufficient Authority, to Enact ſuch Laws as may enable them, to keep their Subjects from committing any thing, which tends, either to the total Deſtruction, or the Subverſion, of the Capital Points of Religion: As if, for inſtance, any one ſhould attempt to deny pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly the Exiſtency of a God, and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, to ſet up plurality of Gods; to worſhip fictitious Gods, or Idols in Gods ſtead, to ſpread abroad Blaſphemies, for to worſhip the Devil, enter with him into a Compact, and ſuch like Actions. For, if theſe are kept within the compaſs of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Thoughts, without breaking out into publick or outward Actions, they are not puniſhable by the Law, neither can any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Power take Cognizance of what is contained only, and hidden in the Heart. And, as to what concerns thoſe Ceremonies which have been annexed to Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, though it be undeniable, that one of the main Points, towards the maintaining a good Order in the State is, that a due Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, ſhould be obſerved in the ſame: Nevertheleſs, Sovereigns need not be ſo very anxious on this Account, becauſe theſe Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences

do not Overturn Religion it ſelf; neither do they (as ſuch conſidered) diſpoſe Subjects to raiſe Diſturbances, and Diſſention in the State.

But the Condition of Mankind being <note place="margin">Of the Nature of revealed Religion.</note> ſuch, That it was impoſſible by the ſole help of Natural Religion, to attain to that Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city which was propoſed by the great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; it had pleaſed the Great and All-wiſe God, to reveal unto us Mortals his Will; and to inſtruct us by what means we may obtain his Favour, and how he expects to be Worſhipped by us. It is for this reaſon, that no body of a right Underſtanding ought to make the leaſt Scruple, but, that all ſuch Matters as God has revealed to us, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſurpaſſing our Natural Underſtanding, ought to be reverenced by Mankind, and to be received with a general conſent and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. Among the ſeveral Doctrines, thus revealed, the Article of Juſtification, or the Purging us from Sins through the Merits of our Saviour, was one of the Principal ones. And, I am of Opinion, that theſe bloody Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, which from the very Beginning of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60718:17"/>
the World were Inſtituted by God's Command, were ſo many Emblems of this our Redemption by the Blood of Chriſt; for, without this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, it would ſeem ſcarce Rational, that a living Creature, ſenſible of Death and Pains, and which cannot be killed without great Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhould be deſtroyed for the Honour of its Creator. As if Man ſhould enter into the Work-Houſe of an Artificer, and by deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Handy-Work, pretend to do him an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Honour. This moſt Antient way of Sacrificing (the chief Badge of True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, before it was Corrupted by Ignorance or Superſtition) though it was no ſmall addition to Natural Religion; yet did it cauſe no alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as to the Exerciſe of it. For, in the State of Natural Freedom, every one had a right to Sacrifice, though at the ſame time, every one was not obliged to Sacrifice for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For, this Ceremony of Sacrificing being only an Emblem, repreſenting the future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Mankind, one and the ſame Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice might anſwer that End, in reſpect to all that were preſent at the time of the Sacrifice. From hence it was become a Cuſtom, that the Heads of each Family uſed to Sacrifice for the reſt; and if more Families were aſſembled in order to Sacrifice, it was to be Adminiſtred by him that was choſen by the reſt, for that purpoſe. And it is obſervable, that the ſame Perſon that had the Right of Sacrificing, had alſo the Power of preſcribing time and place for that Sacrifice. Thus when afterwards God had Ordained the Ceremony or Sacrament of Circumciſion; <hi>Abraham</hi> did Adminiſter the

And, that theſe Predictions or Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies might not, through length of time, come to decay, and be buried in Oblivion, God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty had in a moſt peculiar manner, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them to the Care and Cuſtody of the Jews, amongſt whom, he, as it may be ſaid, kept his Records of Propheſies; it being the moſt likely, that that ſame Nation, from whence the Meſſias was one day to have his Off ſpring as Man, upon Earth, would preſerve them with their utmoſt Care, to their great Honour and Advantage.

For, when afterwards, inſtead of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, a Temple was to be Erected, that is to ſay, when inſtead of a ſlight and decayed Building, a moſt noble and firm Structure was to be built, the ſame was not undertaken without God's Advice. This Temple being the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of all Publick Structures, it was the King's Care to ſee it Repaired in due time, who alſo might levy a Tax for that uſe, and provide
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60718:20"/>
for the neceſſary Expences of the Workmen; it is very remarkable, that we do not read in the Scriptures, that any of thoſe Kings that introduced Foreign Service among the Jews, did ever attempt to force by Threats, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, their Subjects to ſuch a Worſhip, but rather by ſeveral Allurements enticed them to follow their Example, and that ſuch as were thus ſeduced, did, as well as their King, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Condign Puniſhment from God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; And that ſuch among the Jews as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred this Idolatry, ought not to be look'd upon as Rebellious Subjects upon that ſcore, but as Perſons that did bear this Publick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity with Patience. And, as thoſe Kings, that Aboliſhed Idolatry and Foreign Worſhip amongſt the Jews, are highly extolled in the Scriptures, ſo thoſe Impious Kings, that were the Authors of this Idolatry, were by the high Rank, they bore in the State, exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the ordinary Puniſhment, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to God's Ordinance, was elſe to be infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted upon all others, that ſhould attempt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Idolatry.

                  </gap>les had in forgiving, and retaining of Sins, a due enquiry muſt be made, of what is to be underſtood, by forgiving and retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sins? He, that does an unjuſt Act, commits an Offence both againſt the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, whoſe Authority is thereby voilated, and againſt him, who is damnified by it. Beſides this, there are ſome Offences of ſuch a Nature, as to touch whole Societies, as far as their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is thereby impair'd, the Crime com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60718:32"/>
by one of their Members, being often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times attributed to the whole Body. It is therefore from the Damage, which the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator, a ſingle Perſon, or whole Society, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by ſuch an Offence, that an Action lies, againſt the Offender; In the ſame manner as a Creditor has a right to ſue his Debtor for a Debt, contracted with him. In which reſpect it is, that Sins are often called Debts in the holy Scripture. But, in this double, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, threefold Action, which ariſes from one Offence committed againſt ſeveral Perſons, each is to be conſidered as ſeparate from the other; ſo, that, tho' one Action be taken off, the other remains notwithſtanding this, in full force: For, as God does not remit Sins, <note place="margin">Mat. 5 23. 24.</note> without Satisfaction given from the Offender, to the offended Perſon; So, tho' the Offender be reconciled to the offended, nevertheleſs is he obliged to ſeek for Remiſſion of his Sin by God; And, if the Offence be hainous, and of ſuch a Nature, as to be ſcandalous to a whole Society, he ought there, alſo to endeavour his Reconcilation, by begging forgiveneſs of them. Therefore, to remit a Sin, is the ſame Thing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> to remit an Action, or to releaſe one from an Action, which the offended Party had againſt the Offender. And he, that has an Action againſt another, by reaſon of ſome Offence committed againſt him, may proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſaid, to have Power to remit that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or Sin, as far as his Action reaches. For, God himſelf does not make uſe of his uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled Power of remitting of Sins; ſo, as without any further Reſpect, and by his mere
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60718:32"/>
Pleaſure to remit their Sins to ſome, and to puniſh others. For, to pardon Offences pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly, without any further regard but bare Pleaſure, is in effect to render Laws inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual; and Laws are made to no purpoſe by him, who at the ſame time grants a Licenſe of Treſpaſſing againſt them. And, becauſe it was beyond all Human Power to give Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to God Almighty for our Offences, our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt has made uſe of a moſt wonderful Moderation betwixt Juſtice and Mercy, in giving due Satisfaction in his own Perſon; So, that, whoever by the Faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriates the ſame to himſelf, thereby obtains Remiſſion of his Sins from God. And, as to that part, which belongs to Men to forgive, God has commanded them not to be rigorous, if the Offender beg forgiveneſs, becauſe every one of us muſt every day expect Forgiveneſs of his Sins from God Almighty; and we all commit ſometimes Offences againſt our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who, if they would all act rigorouſly with us, our Condition would be moſt deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.

                  <hi>the Books are to be opened, and every one is to be judged according to his Works;</hi> and that without Appeal: It ought alſo to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, That, tho' we have obtained pardon for an Offence from our Neighbour, this does not always and neceſſarily imply a Pardon from God Almighty; for it, is poſſible, that, notwithſtanding a Pardon obtained from Men, God has not abſolved us from that Offence; as for inſtance, if the Offender be without true Faith, or an Hypocrite: And, on the other hand, it is posſible that our Offences are forgiven by God, when forgiveneſs has been denied us by Men; as in caſe, our Neighbour refuſes to pardon an Offence, tho' we beg Forgiveneſs, and profer Satisfaction to be made; or, a Prieſt, being overcome by private Pasſion, ſhould deny us Abſolution; When therefore the Prieſt ſays; <hi>Thy Sins are forgiven unto thee,</hi> it is not always to be taken for granted, that Chriſt does then make uſe of the ſame Words; For, God alone is the Judge of our Faith, and even our Thoughts; But Men can only give their Judgment according to ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, or outward Signs, as effect our Senſes, which often prove deceitful, and far different from what we keep concealed within us. And, tho' in Civil Courts of Judicature it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, if Judgment be given in a Caſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what is proved by Evidence, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſame may be contrary to Truth; it is quite otherwiſe with God Almighty, who,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60718:35"/>
ſearching into the very bottom of our Hearts, cannot be deceived by Hypocriſie. And, tho' the Prieſt ſhould tell thee a hundred times over and over, thy Sins are forgiven unto the, and thou art deſtitute of Faith, it can avail thee nothing. Laſtly, it ought not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, that, when God did give unto the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, he did not thereby ſurrender all his Power of forgiving Sins, or of receiving penitent Sinners into his Favour; or did debar himſelf from making uſe of this Power, unleſs by the means of Prieſts, ſo as to reſerve only to himſelf the Supream Prerogative of remitting of Sins, in caſe of an unjuſt refuſal of the Prieſt; No, by no means; for if this were granted, it would be in vain for us to pray every day; <hi>Forgive us our Sins.</hi> All theſe things duely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, are evident Proofs, that, when it is ſaid, that the Keys of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven were given unto the Apoſtles, it is to be underſtood from the Doctrine of the Goſpel, which creats of the remiſſion of Sins through our Faith in Chriſt; when the Apoſtles taught this Doctrine to the Believers, it was ſaid of them, that they forgave Sins, in the ſame ſenſe as they are ſaid to ſave others by Preaching the Goſpel to the Believers. And on the contrary, <note place="margin">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60718:35"/>
being unbelieving, refuſed to accept this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. So, that, when a Miniſter of the Church applies this Doctrine of the Goſpel to one particular Perſon, he ſays thus much to him: <hi>If thou believeſt according to thy Confeſſion, I announce and confirm unto thee Remiſſion of thy Sins, through the Merits of Chriſt; ſo, that thou mayeſt be now aſſured, that the ſame are forgiven by Chriſt in Heaven: But if thou not believeſt, thy Sins are not forgiven.</hi> For, remiſſion of Sins is the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequence of Faith, even before the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution is pronounced by the Prieſt; it being not left to the arbitrary Pleaſure of Men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to apply the gracious Doctrine of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins to a believing Perſon, or not; But, he that believes, is thereby juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, notwithſtanding he be prevented from receiving Abſolution from the Prieſt. Out of what has been ſaid, it is evident, that, according to the Intention of our Saviour, theſe Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven were not to be made uſe of for the Eſtabliſhment of a Temporal State, or to gain other Temporal Advantages. For, Chriſt ordered the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to preach Remiſſion of Sins, and give for nothing, what they had received for nothing; but not to traffick with the Word of God. Neither did they, by preaching the Goſpel, make Men ſubject to themſelves, but to Chriſt; Nay, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> could not underſtand without Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that ſome among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> would <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 12, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Unto this we anſwer in the Negative; provided the ſame be taken according to the proper Uſe and End of its genuine and primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Inſtitution. For, that this Power may with conveniency enough, be made uſe of, (if miſapplied) to ſerve an ambitious Deſign, and to keep the poor People in awe, is ſufficiently proved by Experience. It ſeems to me, that there was a remarkable Difference betwixt the Excommunication of the Jews, by virtue of which they were excluded from their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and the Excommunication uſed among the Primitive Chriſtians. For, among the Jews, where the Sovereigns and the People profeſſed one and the ſame Religion (which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60718:37"/>
alſo was entirely united with the State) it might eaſily happen, that the Excluſion from the Synagogue, did carry along with it ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inconveniencies in Civil Affairs, and might therefore not unjuſtly be conſidered at the ſame time, as a Civil Puniſhment; which, rendered the Offenders infamous in the Commonwealth; Eſpecially, ſince, according to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Conſtitution of that Government, there were ſeveral things belonging to Religion pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable by their civil Conſtitutions. But, it being already put beyond Queſtion, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Saviour, nor his Apoſtles, did ever pretend to any Civil Power; and that beſides this, the Primitive Chriſtians lived under the Juriſdiction of other Princes, how could their Excommunication, Ban, or what other ſort of Eccleſiaſtical Cenſine was uſed among them, be ſuppoſed to have any influence upon the Civil State and Condition of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; or to have been of the ſame nature and force (properly ſpeaking) as Civil Puniſhments are? This will more plainly appear, if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine thoſe Paſſages, where this Matter is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly treated of in the New Teſtament: It is ſaid in <hi>Matthew</hi> 18. 15. 16, 17. <hi>If thy Brother ſhall treſpaſs againſt thee, go, and tell him his Fault, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and him alone; If he ſhall hear thee, thou haſt gained thy Brother. But, if he will not hear thee, then take with thee One or Two more, that in the mouth of two or three Witneſſes every Word may be eſtabliſhed. And if he ſhall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the Church, but if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as a Heathen Man and a Publican.</hi> Certainly out of this paſſage, nothing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60718:37"/>
can be inferr'd that has any relation to a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Juriſdiction or Sovereignty; but bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhews us, how differences ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed among Chriſtians. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> ordains, <note place="margin">1 Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So, that, tho' it is elſe required from the Offender to beg the Pardon of, and <note place="margin">

If this prove fruitleſs, he ſays, he ought to take along with him two or three Witneſſes, to try whether they can prevail with his Adverſary to bring him to a more pliable Temper; and at the ſame time, may teſtifie, That the offended Party, did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer every thing which might tend towards a Reconciliation betwixt them; But, if after all this, he remain obſtinate, the Difference ought to be referr'd to the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Believers, reſiding in that Place; (for I ſee no reaſon why by the word <hi>Eccleſia</hi> or Church, the <hi>Preſbyters</hi> only ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.)

So, the Apoſtle bids us, to reject a Man that is a Heretick, after the firſt and ſecond Admonition, leſt we <note place="margin">Tit. 3. 10.

the Converſation of ſuch People, as he thinks may be reproach, or hurtful to him, without implying a prejudice to their Reputation in Civil Affairs.

After theſe Inſtructions given, Chriſt foretels them what Perſecutions and Dangers they muſt undergo, all which, he will have them to overcome, not by Force, but by Patience, by ſhewing their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 10, 11.</note> or flying to another Place.

Neither was it in their Power to have acquired any great Territories, it being obvious, that they lived always under another Juriſdiction, and in ſuch Places, where the Government was already Eſtabliſhed. Nor had they any Authority to exact upon their Auditors, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what they were pleaſed to allot them by voluntary Contribution; For, if they ſhould

have attempted any thing beyond it, no doubt but thoſe Magiſtrates, under whoſe Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they lived, might legally have ſtopt their Proceedings, as done in prejudice of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.

It is furthermore to be conſicered, whether the Doctrine of Chriſt, which unites <note place="margin">The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies no Temporal Sovereignty</note> our Hearts under the Obedience of Chriſt by the Faith, does not, by vertue of this Union, conſtitute a certain Sovereignty reſembling the Sovereign Power of our Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? To this we anſwer in the Negative; as it may plainly appear, to thoſe, that will duely conſider the Nature and Qualifications, which are in the holy Scripture attributed to the Kingdom of Chriſt, and the Kingdom of Heaven here upon Earth. It is without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, that the Union of the Believers under Chriſt, their King, ought to be conſidered as a Kingdom or Empire, but ſuch a one as is not of this World, and conſequently of a quite
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60718:40"/>
different nature from that Sovereign Power, which is exerciſed in a Civil Government. Chriſt is there the King, who having withdrawn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from our ſight, has as it may be ſaid, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled his Court in Heaven. His ſubjects are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed throughout all parts of the World, where the Chriſtian Doctrine is taught and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Believers, who, by the intrinlick, Vertue of this Doctrine, are confirmed in their Faith, and made proof againſt all the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations and Malice of this World. The Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Power does not reach this Kingdom; true Piety being not to be implanted by Human Force, which is inſufficient to procure God's Grace, or raiſe thoſe inward Motions which are chiefly acceptable to God Almighty; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, all our exterior Actions, that may be enforced by a Civil Authority, are to be deem'd vain and fruitleſs. For, the Kingdom of Chriſt being a Kingdom of Truth, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no Civil Power or Force; For, Truth, by the help of the Chriſtian Doctrine, and with the aſſiſtance of God's Grace, does gently inſinuate it ſelf into the Hearts of Men, and the Rewards or Puniſhments, which thoſe are to receive, that either accept or deſpiſe this Doctrine, are reſerved for the Life to come. He that will be pleaſed to examine thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Paſſages, where mention is made of the Kingdom of Chriſt, or the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, may ſoon be convinced, that not any thing is to be met withal there, which has the leaſt reſemblance to a Civil Power or Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

But how is it poſſible to imagine that any Church or Congregation of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſhould ever, or ought to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo entirely to the Pleaſure and Diſpoſal of their Teachers; as to oblige themſelves to acquieſce barely in, and to follow blindly, whatever ſhall be propoſed by them, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing and leading to the way of Salvation; it being certain without contradiction, that

none of the Believers do entirely ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Faith to any Body but to God Almighty, whoſe Will and Commands ought to be interpreted by the Teachers of the Church, and their Auditors to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to a due Compliance with them.

For, granting ſuch <note place="margin">Whether it be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſet up a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Judge of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies in the Church?</note> an univerſal Judge of all Controverſies ariſing in the Church, he muſt be ſuppoſed to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, (and that beyond all contradiction) as well in point of Matter of Fact, as to the lawfulneſs of the Caſe; for it may ſo happen, that it be plain enough, whether a Doctrine be erroneous or not, when at the ſame time, it may be diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, whether the ſaid Error ought to be laid to a certain Man's Charge or not? For, if an Appeal be allowed from this Judge, after Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence pronounced, there will never be an end of the Proceſs. It is therefore abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that this infallible Authority ſhould be ſo manifeſtly proved, that it cannot reaſonably be called in queſtion. For, unleſs this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity be unqueſtionable for the deciſion of this Controverſie, we muſt run from this Judge to another, who muſt alſo be ſuppoſed to be Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, and ſo in infinite; it being granted by all, without Exception, that no body ought to be a Judge in his own Caſe. And, ſince this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of being Infallible, could not be granted by any body, but by God alone; (the whole Body of Chriſtians, being not inveſted with ſuch a Power) it muſt plainly be proved out of the Scriptures, that this particular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative and Authority was granted to one certain Perſon, for him and his Succeſſors to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60718:53"/>
decide all Controverſies concerning the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith, without being liable to any Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. But, of this there is not the leaſt foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep in the holy Scripture; Nay, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, when they were ſent by Chriſt into all the World, were endued with the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and had an equal Authority. So, that there is but one way now left, for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the true Knowledge of the Chriſtian Religion, both for the Teachers in the Church, and all Believers in general, which is, to ſtudy the Scriptures devoutly, and without Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. And whoever pretends to Inſpiration, <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 14. 15.</note> or to a prophetical Spirit, ought by undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Demonſtrations to juſtifie his Pretenſions. Theſe Qualifications, which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes in the 2 Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy, c.</hi> 2. 24, 25, ought to be applied to all Biſhops and Teachers in general: <hi>And the Servant of the Lord,</hi> he ſays, <hi>muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Men, apt to teach patiently.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60718:54"/>
to his Judgment. Beſides this, it muſt be ſuppoſed, that this univerſal Judge (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be to be look'd upon as an uſeleſs En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine) muſt be inveſted with a Power to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his Decrees, and to oblige all Chriſtians to acquieſce in his Judgment; For, if it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that his Decrees have no other force, than as far as they influence People by the force of Truth, they would be either uſeleſs, or elſe this Judge in vain pretends thereby to any further Prerogative, but what he has in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with other Chriſtians that apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Study of the holy Scripture. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, this obliging Power muſt either have been obtained by a peculiar Privilegde granted by God Almighty, or by a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Chriſtians, or by an inherent Right to a Sovereignty over all the Chriſtian Churches. As for a priviledge granted by God, or the general conſent of the Chriſtian Churches, there is not the leaſt Proof of it, as far as ever I could find; And as to the pretended Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power, its legal Title ought to be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch Documents as are ſuitable to ſo great a Pretenſion. For it is a very inſignificant Proof, to alledge in a caſe of ſuch Moment Tradition, and a long continued Uſurpation, which adds nothing to the right of a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued illegal Poſſeſſion, and cannot be taken for a ſolid Foundation, whereupon to build a real Pretenſion to ſuch a Sovereignty; for it is poſſible, that, whereas ſomething of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative was intended in the primitive times, the ſame, in proceſs of Time, has been abuſed, and conſequently degenerated into an inſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60718:55"/>
to an incurable Gangren. It is alſo to be taken notice of, that if this Eccleſiaſtical So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty be granted, there muſt of neceſſity be a double headed Sovereign Power in one State; it being evident, that Subjects would be obliged to acknowledge the Authority of this Eccleſiaſtical Judge in point of Controverſie, as well, and in the ſame meaſure, as they do the Authority of their civil Governours in civil Actions. And, ſince this Eccleſiaſtical Sovereignty has a different ſcope from that, for which Civil Societies were erected, it muſt conſequently be of a quite different nature, and make up a particular Sovereignty. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if both theſe ſhould happen to be joined in one Perſon, he becomes thereby at once maſter over our Lives and Conſciences: But, if this Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction be lodged in another Perſon, he muſt either at the ſame time be acknowledged to have a Power of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his Decrees, by his own Prerogative, or elſe to have only an Authority of giving Sentence, leaving the Execution of it to the civil Magiſtrates. If the firſt of theſe two be ſuppoſed, it is evident, that a double headed Sovereignty muſt carry along with it great Inconveniencies and Diſtractions; and if the latter, thoſe that exerciſe the Sovereignty in the State, muſt be look'd upon as Executioners only to this holy Judge. All theſe Things due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, as they muſt needs occaſion great Convulſions in the State, ſo no man that is not beyond his Wits will be apt to imagine, (unleſs it be made appear by moſt evident Proofs) that Chriſt intended to introduce, by
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60718:55"/>
his Doctrine, ſuch pernicious Diſeaſes into ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Societies. For, tho' it is impoſſible, that no Controverſies ſhould be raiſed in the Church, like Chriſt himſelf has foretold it in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by <hi>Matthew, c.</hi> 13. 24. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1 Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians, c.</hi> 11. 19. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, if any Controverſie does ariſe, he that is the firſt Author of it muſt of neceſſity main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Opinion, under a colour at leaſt of its being agreeable to the Scriptures. For, if any one ſhould pretend to introduce a new Article of Faith, without endeavouring to prove it out of the holy Scripture, he would be look'd upon as a mad Man, tho' he ſhould call to his aid all the Sophiſtications of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. And if he ſhould inſiſt upon the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Traditions without the Scriptures, this would only ſerve to diſcloſe the weakneſs of that Foundation whereupon he builds his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. But, if any one ſhould make an attempt againſt any Article of Faith, received alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as ſuch, in the Church, he is ſcarce worth taking notice of, unleſs he ſhould be able to alledge at leaſt, ſome ſpecious Reaſons out of the holy Scripture for his Opinion. And, in ſuch a caſe (eſpecially if his Endeavours ſeem to proceed from a real Love to Truth) he ought not to be abſolutely ſlighted, without being heard, and his Reaſons examined. So, that then the whole deciſion of the Matter muſt depend from a right Interpretation of the ſeveral paſſages in the holy Scripture relating to this Controverſie; And to find out this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, I ſee not any neceſſity, which obliges us to have recourſe to a Sovereign Power, or

And why ſhould it not be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that in each Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, there may be found a ſufficient number of Teachers, capable of diſproving ſuch as pretend to introduce among them In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations, and falſe Doctrines. But, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that theſe alone ſhould prove inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, they may call to their aid thoſe of the Neighbouring moſt famous Churches. From whence it appears, that there is no abſolute Neceſſity of acknowledging a Judge General of Controverſies in the Church. And, put the Caſe, that thoſe that diſſent from the Church, are ſo numerous, as to have ſpread their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine all over the State, this Judge will
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60718:56"/>
prove uſeleſs in his Office; For, if he pretends to have recourſe to violent means to make them renounce their falſe Opinion, they will in all probability oppoſe force to force; But, if he takes the other way, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to convince them of their Earor by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments taken out of the holy Scripture; this may be done as well by other Teachers ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualified for their Office, than by ſuch a Judge General in the Church. Neither ought we to be ſo over timerous as to believe, that Errors ſhould in ſo much prevail over Truth, as to domineer always and every where over it, it being not to be queſtion'd, but that by help of the moſt clear-ſighted Teachers in the Church, theſe Clouds may be ſoon diſperſed, and Truth again appear in its ſplendor. I appeal to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, whether not a great many Hereſies by the only help of prevailing Truth, without the aſſiſtance of ſuch a Judge, or any human Force have by degrees dwindled away, and at laſt quite diſappeared. It muſt be confeſt, there are ſome erroneous Opinions, which being nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and maintained by a Temporal Intereſt, and certain Reaſons of State of ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches, are not ſo eaſie to be ſuppreſſed. Of this kind are thoſe Controverſies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Proteſtants differ with the Papiſhes; All which, if duely conſidered, are ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entangled with the Intereſt of the Popiſh Monarchy, that it is impoſſible for the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> to recede an Inch from the point of the controverted Articles, without diminution of their Authority, and endangering their great Revenues; ſo, that all hopes of an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60718:57"/>
betwixt them and the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> are in vain, unleſs the latter can reſolve to ſubmit themſelves under the ſame Popiſh Yoak which they have ſhaken off ſo long ago. I cannot ſufficiently admire that groſs way of Arguing, made uſe of by the Papiſhes, when they talk of nothing elſe but the Authority of their Church, telling us, that, if we would but once acknowledge the ſame, all the Differences and Queſtions concerning the chief Articles of Faith would fall a-courſe, making themſelves both Party and Judge, and pretending to give Sentence in their own Caſe according to their own Teſtimony. They always make uſe of this Sophiſm, that they attribute only to themſelves the glorious Name of the <hi>True Church,</hi> exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all orher Chriſtians from it, but ſuch as are of the ſame Communion with them. And, to back this pretence, nothing is more common among them, than to lay aſide all manner of demonſtrative Arguments founded in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and in lien thereof, to find out new Methods (unknown to the Apoſtles) of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting People; and to endeavour to eſtabliſh their Authority by all manner of violence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe, that dare to maintain Truth in oppoſition to their Doctrine.

After all had held their

Peace, that is to ſay, no body further appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who could contradict them or oppoſe their Arguments, <hi>James</hi> at laſt aroſe, declaring that the Viſion of <hi>Peter</hi> did agree to the Words of the Prophets, and that therefore it was his Opinion that ſuch among the Centiles as did turn to Chriſt ought not to be troubled. But that they alſo in ſome meaſure might gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie themſelves, and to induce them not to fly the Converſation of ſuch of the Gentiles as received the Chriſtian Faith, it was thought ſit that theſe ſhould abſtain from Pollution of Idols, from Fornication, from things ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, and from Blood, all which was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law, and partly diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Law of Nature; as Fornication, which nevertheleſs was a common Vice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles; the reſt being things indifferent in themſelves, might eaſily be let alone, rather than give Offence to a Brother.

If the whole matter be duly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <note place="margin">Some Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations concerning the natura and uſe of Councils.</note> it furniſhes us with ſeveral Obſervations, which may not a little contribute towards the Explaining the Nature of Eccleſiaſtical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. In the firſt place, it is moſt apparent, that theſe Councils are not ſuch Bodies whoſe Authority is everlaſting for the Government of the Church: But that they are extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Convocations or Conventions, compoſed out of ſome ſelected and moſt eminent Men of the Church, who are called together for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing certain Controverſies ariſen in the Church. And, becauſe thoſe Councils were very frequent in the Church from its Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, this alone may ſerve as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing argument, that the Church never acknowledged one infallible Judge for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding of Controverſies. For, to what purpoſe were ſo many Heads ſet to work, if one ſingle Perſon was ſufficient and infallible in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of them? And (what is yet more) if the Decrees of the Councils had only their obliging Force from his Confirmation. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, thoſe that compoſe ſuch a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil are not to be conſidered as Members of an Aſſembly or Colledge, who by the Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Votes can ſo abſolutely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Queſtion in hand, as to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory to all Chriſtians in general; Truth generally ſpeaking, not depending from the Plurality of Suffrages; much leſs, can they pretend to a legiſlative Power veſted in them ſo as to impoſe what Laws or Canons they pleaſe upon the Church. But, they may be conſidered no otherwiſe than Men deputed by
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60718:59"/>
the Churches for the examining the true Grounds of the Controverſies laid before them, and for ſearching for the Deciſion of them in the Holy Scripture; So that theſe Churches are not obliged to acquieſce in this Deciſion any further than they find it agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Word of God. For it may chance to fall out ſo that a Controverſie which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears at firſt ſight very intricate and difficult, afterwards being well weighed and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thereof duly examined on both ſides, is very plain and eaſy to be determined. But if any moral Decrees are made by a Council, the ſame are to be taken to have no obliging Power, but what proceeds either from a preceding Commiſſion and Authority, or from the Approbation of theſe Churches; ſo that Chuncils have no coercive Power over the Church. I cannot but touch, by the by, upon this Head, <hi>viz.</hi> that this Aſſertion; <hi>The Council is above the Pope,</hi> is of ſuch a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as will eaſily gain credit with all that are guided by right Reaſon, or the Scriptures. For, who can be ſo ſtupid as not to be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that a great many learned Men, who with joint labour apply themſelves to the ſearch after Truth, are to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgment of one ſingle Perſon, and that oftentimes of ſuch a one, who has but a very indifferent inſight into the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Divinity. This ſeems to imply ſomewhat of a Contradiction, that this Point is aſſerted by the ſelf-ſame People, who make the Papal Chair the Center of the Church, and the Pope the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church pretends to be a Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal State; but this Aſſertion of the Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Councils, favours moſt of an Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy. But this Riddle may be unfolded in a few Words: The <hi>French</hi> Clergy allows the Pope to be the Supream Head of the Church, as far as they find it ſuitable with their Intereſt. But whenever he attempts any thing againſt them, or the States Policy of that Kingdom, the old Song of the Liberty of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, and the antient Doctrine of the <hi>Sorbone</hi> is revived, which ſerves the <hi>French</hi> Clergy now and then for a Pretext, to perſuade the vulgar ſort of People, that the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church has not been polluted with thoſe groſs and abominable Errours as are introduced in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> The next thing to be conſidered is, that it is moſt evident, that if a Controverſie ariſes, which may be decided within the Body of one Church, there is no Occaſion for the Communicating in ſuch a Point with other Churches; And, that, in caſe one Church alone is not ſtock'd ſufficiently with able Teachers for the compoſing of the Difference, and therefore muſt call to its Aid thoſe of other Churches, it is ſuperfluous to call together a greater number than may be ſufficient for the accompliſhment of the Work. So did the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> refer the whole Controverſie to thoſe of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> without giving the leaſt Trouble to thoſe of <hi>Phenice</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> though their Deputies paſſed in their Way thither through both theſe Places. Beſides this, the Deputies that are ſent, ought to receive their Authority and Inſtruction
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60718:60"/>
from their ſeveral Churches, whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, becauſe no Church has without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſubmitted herſelf to the Determination of her Teachers, but only as far as their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is agreeable to the Word of God. Neither are the Words in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebr.</hi> c. 13. 17. to be underſtood any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than with this Limitation. Beſides this, it is abſolutely requiſite that ſuch Perſons as have raiſed a Controverſie ſhould be heard in the Council, that their Reaſons ſhould be duely examined, weighed, and proceeded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to the Rules preſcribed in the Holy Writ. And if the Controverſie does not barely concern a Point of Doctrine, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a Temporal Intereſt, thoſe that have any Share in it cannot pretend to a Power of deciding the Point in Prejudice of the adverſe Party. From whence it is evident, that the Points in queſtion betwixt the Proteſtant Church and the Papal Chair cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by any Council, their Difference ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing not barely from Point of Doctrine, but about Domination, Temporal Dignities, and vaſt Revenues. Nor is there the leaſt Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of any Compoſition betwixt theſe two Parties by way of Arbitration; For who is it that can pretend to decide ſo great a Point? Who is likely to be accepted of as an Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor by both Parties? The Proteſtants, in all likelihood, will not be ſo fooliſh as to ſubmit themſelves and their Caſe to the Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any Aſſembly conſiſting all of <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks their ſworn Enemies; nor can they have the Imprudence as to ask it. And as for
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60718:61"/>
the Pope, he likes his Station too well, to put it to the Hazard of an Arbitration. But if an Aſſembly ſhould be propoſed to conſiſt of an equal Number choſen by each Party, this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient would ſcarce take, it being to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they would ſcarce keep within the bounds of Moderation, and that the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly would appear ſometimes not unlike the Feaſt of the Centaures.</p>

It is evident enough, That they were of the nature of Colledges, or ſuch Societies, where a great many are joined for the carrying on a certain Buſineſs, under this limitation nevertheleſs, as not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent from the Civil Juriſdiction. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature of the Colledges and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, <hi>Jacobus Cujachus</hi> may be conſulted before all others, 7 <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 30, and 16; and <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 3, and 5. And it is here very well worth our moſt particular Obſervation, that ſuch Societies as were erected for the exerciſe of Religion were by Publick Authority allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of in the antient <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. This is atteſted among a great many others, by <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoras,</hi> in the beginning of his Apology for the Chriſtians, when he ſays<hi>: It is by your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, you greateſt of Princes, that ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions live according to their own Customs and Laws, and every one, without being controuled by any Penal Statutes, freely exerciſe the ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>

                  <hi>in which he was educated.</hi> And thus he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds immediately after: <hi>All Mankind offer their Sacrifices, and uſe other Religious Ceremonies, according to the Cuſtom of their Native Country.</hi> This Liberty of Conſcience was, among others, the true cauſe, why the Chriſtian Religion in ſo ſhort a time did ſpread it ſelf all over ſo vaſt an Empire, and why in the beginning, very few oppoſed its Progreſs, the Magiſtrates not thinking it belonging to their Province to intermeddle with it, And this is one Reaſon, why we never read of the Apoſtles having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired leave from the Civil Magiſtrates to preach the Goſpel, or to plant a Church. Tho' an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Reaſon may be given, why the Apoſtles were not obliged to ask leave from the Civil Magiſtrates for the Conſtituting of Chriſtian Churches; becauſe the Apoſtles had received their immediate Authority of Preaching the Goſpel from him, who is the <hi>King of kings,</hi> and by whoſe Command all Mankind were then call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to repentance. From what has been ſaid, this rational Concluſion may be drawn; That the Apoſtles had not only a Power to plant Churches in all places, where they found their Auditors inclined to receive the Doctrine of the Goſpel, but that, alſo in all other places, whither this Doctrine was tranſplanted, the Believers might enter into ſuch a Society, or plant a Church upon their own accord, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Commiſſion or Permiſſion for ſo doing, from the Apoſtles; but, that, purſuant to our Saviour's Expreſſion, it was ſufficient, if two or three were inclined to meet in his Name. If we trace the true nature of theſe Societies,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60718:62"/>
which are conſtituted by a free Choice and Conſent of certain Men. we may eaſily find to contain, all of them, ſomething reſembling a Democracy, where ſuch Matters as concern the whole Body of the Society are to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched by common Conſent, and where no particular Perſon can claim any further Power over the reſt, than what he has received by their joint Conſent. From whence it may be rationally concluded, that at the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the Power of Conſtituting Teachers, and other Miniſters of the Church, was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally lodged in the whole Church, or, the whole Congregation of the Believers. And, tho' it is unqueſtionable, that in the firſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, Teachers were conſtituted by the Apoſtles in a great many places; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies ſomething of a Democracy, and is often uſed in the Scriptures in this Caſe) argues ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, that this was not done without the Approbation of the Church. It would be a hard Task to prove, that the Apoſtles did conſtitute Teachers themſelves in all leſſer Towns, or that they preached the Goſpel in all leſſer Places and Villages. It ſeems rather probable, that the Goſpel was publiſhed by the Apoſtles in great Cities, and other places of note; from whence it was communicated unto other Places; and, that ſuch Churches, as were not provided with Teachers, Biſhops, or Presbyters by the Apoſtles themſelves, or their ſpecial Authority, uſed either to chuſe thoſe very Perſons to that Function, who were the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel among them,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60718:62"/>
or any others, whom they eſteemed to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, before others, with the Gift of Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. If we conſult the Epiſtle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> it ſeems that the Goſpel had been taught at <hi>Rome,</hi> before ever <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> came thither; And the High Treaſurer of the <note place="margin">Chap. 16.</note> Queen <hi>Candaces,</hi> who is generally believed to have firſt carried the Doctrine of the Goſpel to <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and to have been the firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Chriſtian Churches in thoſe Parts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no Ordination as a Biſhop or Presbyter from <hi>Philip,</hi> after his Baptiſm. Neither did <note place="margin">Acts 8.</note> Chriſt or his Apoſtles preſcribe any certain Form, to be uſed in the Ordination of Biſhops, as he did in the uſe of the Sacraments; which ſeems to prove that for the obtaining of this Function, there is nothing more required, than for the Perſon to be called by the Church, and to have the Gift of Teaching. It is not to be denied, but that the Ordination of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and Impoſition of Hands by the Biſhops and Presbyters is a very laudable and uſeful Ceremony, and ought to be received as ſuch, with this reſtriction nevertheleſs, that the ſame need not to be deemed ſo abſolutely neceſſary, as if without it no Perſon ought to be taken for a true Miniſter of the Church; eſpecially ſince theſe miraculous Gifts which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that Ceremony in the Infancy of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church are many Ages paſt, become uſeleſs. The Church, like all other Colledges, <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4<hi>:</hi> 14.</note> have power to collect Stipends for their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and to make Collections for the Uſe of the Poor; but in a different degree from that which belongs to Civil Magiſtrates or Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60718:63"/>
who levy Taxes. and have a Power to force their Subjects to a compliance with their Commands; But, in the Church this Power is founded upon the meer Liberality and free Conſent of all the Believers in general, who being made ſenſible of their Duty of paying a Workman his Stipend, and relieving thoſe in Diſtreſs, ought not to refuſe ſuch Acts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Humanity. It properly belongs to all <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 2, 3. c. 2. 12, 13. c. 9. 5, 9, 7.</note> Colledges as well as Churches, to have a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to make, with joint Conſent of their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ſuch Statutes, as may conduce towards the obtaining the Ends of their Society, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they do not interfere with the legal Rights of their Sovereigns. Of this kind are theſe Statutes, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> recommends to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, in the 7 <hi>Chapt.</hi> If any one acted contrary to theſe Rules, he deſervedly was to receive Correction, or to undergo ſuch a Penalty as was dictated by the Statute, and which was to be laid upon him not by Vertue of an Inherent Power in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but purſuant to their Contract. And, tho' Colledges have not any Power or Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over their Members, unleſs what is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely requiſite for the obtaining the true end of each Society, or elſe has been granted to them by their Sovereigns; Nevertheleſs, it is often practiſed in theſe Societies, and may be done without prejudice to the Rights of their Sovereigns, that, if any Differences ariſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Members of one and the ſame Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, theſe are compoſed by the Interpoſition and Arbitration of the reſt of the Members of that Colledge or Society, to the End, that a
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60718:63"/>
mutual good Correſpondency may be cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among them. In which ſenſe is to be taken the Admonition which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> concerning this point in the 1 E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, in the 6 <hi>Chapter,</hi> in the firſt and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Verſes.</hi> Laſtly, becauſe many Vices were at the time of the firſt publiſhing of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in vogue among the Heathens, which were not puniſhable by the Pagan Laws, they being more encouraged to the obſervance of Moral Duty by the proſpect of Honours than by any civil Commands; And, the Chriſtians believing it more peculiarly belonging to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to recommend and adorn their Profeſſion by a holy Life, and, by an innocent Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to excel the Heathens, ſome Statutes were, at the very beginning, introduced into the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, which were thought moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to correct all manner of Licentiouſneſs, according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Direction: <hi>If any one that is called a Brother be a Fornicator, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>or an Idolater, or a Railer, or a Drunkard, or an Extortioner, with ſuch a one do not eat.</hi> From whence it appears, that in the primitive Times, Church Cenſure was uſed in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, all which may eaſily be ſuppoſed to have been done without the leaſt prejudice to the Sovereign Power, it being always for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the State, that Subjects ſhould lead an innocent Life. It is worth our Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Puniſhments inflicted by vertue of theſe Statutes, were of ſuch a nature, as might be put in execution without the leaſt prejudice to the Civil Government; ſuch were private Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, publick Reprimands, and Church
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60718:64"/>
Penances, the extream Remedy was Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, by vertue of which, a Member of the Church was either for a time deprived from enjoying the benefit of the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or entirely excluded from being a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church. This being the utmoſt, unto which any Colledge can pretend, <hi>viz.</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to exclude a Member of their Society. This Excluſion, tho' in it ſelf conſidered, of the greateſt moment, (ſince thereby a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian was deprived of the whole Communion with the Church) Nevertheles did not alter the Civil State or Condition of a Subject; But thoſe that were thus excommunicated ſuffered no loſs in their Dignities, Honour, Rights, or Fortunes. For, that the Church Cenſures ſhould extend to the real Prejudice of the civil Condition of any Subject, is not any ways re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for the obtaining the Ends for which the Church is Eſtabliſhed; Neither can it be ſuppoſed, that without defrauding Sovereigns of their Right, ſuch a Power can be exerciſed over Subjects, unleſs with their own Conſent, and by vertue of a publick Civil Authority.</p>

Notwithſtanding all this, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion does not in any wiſe impair or ecclipſe the legal Rights of Sovereigns, but rather confirms and eſtabliſhes the civil Power, <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 21.

Notwithſtanding this, the Church is thereby not exalted from a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to a State, ſince, by the receiving of the Chriſtian Religion, the civil Government does not undergo any Alteration or Diminution; On the contrary, Sovereigns looſe nothing of their legal Rights, neither are Subjects in any

It is a fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous Objection, that the Church and civil Government have different Ends and Objects, not repugnant to one another; For, from thence is not to be inferred, that the Church muſt be a State, or that the Chriſtian Religion cannot be propagated, maintained or exerciſed, without the Church aſſume the ſame Power that belongs to the civil Government. In theſe places therefore, where the whole Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the Prince profeſs the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the Commonwealth receives the Church into its Protection, and, tho' ſtrictly united, there is no colliſion or emulation betwixt them, nor does either of them receive any prejudice in their reſpective Rights, but without the leaſt Interference with one another, the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a Colledge, whereof the Prince, and all the Subjects are now become Members. So, that each Subject, beſides the Perſon he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the State, has aſſumed that of a Chriſtian, and in this reſpect is eſteemed a Member of the Church.

For Mankind being ſo perverſe in its Nature, that in Matters, even the moſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, if managed without controul, they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom let it ſlip through their hands without a Stain; And that therefore it is ſcarce to be queſtioned, but the Chriſtian Doctrine is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the ſame Corruption, and that under Pretence of Religion many pernicious Deſigns may be hatched againſt the Intereſt of the Commonwealth. A Prince in whoſe Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a Church is planted, if he afterwards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the Communion of that Church, has queſtionleſs a Right to examin what Matters, and in what Manner they are tranſacted in the Convention of their Presbyters, or in their Eccleſiaſtical Courts, if there be any ſuch among them; Whether they do not tranſgreſs their Bounds? whether they act according to the Civil Laws, or whether they do not aſſume to themſelves a Power to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ſuch Caſes as properly belong to the Civil Juriſdiction? Of this Kind are Matrimonial Caſes, which without Reaſon, and upon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſlender Pretences, the Prieſts have drawn
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60718:68"/>

And becauſe the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Church make uſe of Church di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, the Prince may make a legal Enquiry whether, under Pretence of theſe Rules pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by our Saviour, they do not intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Novelties, which may prove prejudicial to the State? And as theſe Enchroachments are no eſſential Part of the Chriſtian Doctrine, but rather to be looked upon like Spots which diſgniſe its natural Beauty; So, I cannot ſee with what Face it can be denied, that thoſe ought to be taken off, eſpecially by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of thoſe whoſe Intereſt is moſt nearly concerned; unleſs they have Impudence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to own, that the Chriſtian Religion may lawfully be miſapplied to By-uſes.

Becauſe the Right of Conſtituting <note place="margin">Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Right of Princes, as to Church Miniſters.</note> Miniſters of the Church does originally belong to the whole Congregation the Prince muſt needs have his Share in it, as being a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Congregation; I ſay his Share: For it is not reaſonable that a Miniſter ſhould be forced upon any Church againſt their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and without their Approbation, except it be for very weighty Reaſons. For, the Right of Conſtituting Miniſters in the Church does not belong to the Prince in the ſame manner, as it is his Prerogative to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute Civil Magiſtrates and other Publick Miniſters of State, which being a part of the Sovereign Power, cannot be called in queſtion. But Teachers in the Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered meerly as ſuch, are none of the King's Miniſters, but Servants of Chriſt, and Miniſters of the Church, not Officers of the State. And becauſe, in the Primitive Church, Miniſters uſed to be conſtituted by <gap reason="foreign">

For, a Teacher thus forced upon his Auditors, for whom they have neither eſteem nor Love, is likely to edifie but little by his Doctrine. Nevertheleſs, Sovereigns ought to have a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60718:69"/>
watchful Eye over the Churches, and to take care that Perſons not fitly qualified for this ſacred Function, may not be promoted to the Miniſtry either by Simony or other unlawful Means: For though it is the Intereſt of the whole Church to provide againſt theſe Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, Sovereigns are likely to do it with much better Succeſs than can be expected from private Perſons. They may authoriſe certain Perſons to be preſent at theſe Elections, and who, by their Authority, may prevent all manner of Diſorder or Corruption, and at the ſame time make a due enquiry, whether ſuch Perſons as are to be put into the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry are of an approved Life and Doctrine. And, becauſe the Miniſters of the Church do <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3 10.</note> ſometimes act negligently or prepoſterouſly in their Office, which often proves the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Scandal and Schiſm in the Church, <note place="margin">Rom. 16 17.</note> Sovereigns may conſtitute over them Inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, with an Authority to reprove, and ſometimes to puniſh ſuch as tranſgreſs their Rules. But theſe Inſpectors, being no leſs ſubject to human Frailties than other men, Care ought to be taken that their Authority be ſo limited as to be accountable of all their Proceedings, either to the Prince, or before a Conſiſtory authoriſed for that purpoſe, if they tranſgreſs their Bounds or treſpaſs upon the Miniſters of the Church. As all theſe maters do contribute to the maintaining of good Order in the Church, and may beſt be put in execution by the Sovereign Authority; So it is manifeſt, that Princes, as they are chief Members of the Church, may juſtly

But, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the general Converſion of whole Commonwealths to the Chriſtian Faith, care ought to be taken, that Holineſs of Life be not laid aſide among Chriſtians; from whence ariſes this Queſtion: Whether it be better to make uſe of the antient Church Diſcipline now, in the ſame manner as it was practiſed in the Primitive times? Or, whether it be not more expedient to admit of ſome Alterations, after Sovereigns are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Communion of the Church? The laſt of theſe two ſeems to be moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable; becauſe this antient Church Diſcipline which was introduced for a certain time, to ſupply the deficiency of the Pagan Laws, and to amend their vicious Lives and Converſation, and was thus left to the direction of certain People, is not an Eſſential part of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and, beſides this, carries this Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency along with it, that it may eaſily degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into a kind of a pretended Soveraignty, and prove prejudicial to the Civil Power. And, as Soveraigns have a Right to provide againſt every thing that may be the probable cauſe of Convulſions in the State; ſo may this defect be ſupplied by the Civil Laws, and Vices may be ſuppreſſed by Civil Puniſhments. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I ſee any reaſon to the contrary, why
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60718:71"/>
Vices ſhould not be as eaſily corrected by Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments preſcribed by the Civil Laws, as by Church-Cenſures; or, why the firſt ſhould not prove as effectual as the latter for the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Publick Scandals? It will perhaps be objected, That Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline has a much greater Influence over Chriſtians towards the amendment of their Lives, than Civil Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments; becauſe the firſt penetrates into the Heart; whereas Civil Puniſhments do not touch us but ſuperficially: Unto this it may be anſwered, That Church-Diſcipline does not always anſwer this end, it being not to be doubted, but that ſome Men, tho' they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go all the Church-Penances, retain in their hearts the ſame vicious Inclinations, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times grow more ſtubborn and bold. But if it be taken as an Expiation for our Sins in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of God Almighty, it is to be obſerved, that if we pretend to an Expiation for any Treſpaſſes, which fall under the cognizance of Humane Laws, we muſt therein be directed by the Word of God, which does not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Church-Penance as a proper Satisfaction in this caſe. For our ſins are not remitted, becauſe we have undergone Church-Penance, but becauſe our Hearts are purified by the Blood of Chriſt, provided we, by the Faith, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his Sufferings unto us. But, ſuppoſing it ſhould be thought moſt convenient, that ſome ſort of Vices ought to be corrected by Church-Diſcipline, the beſt Expedient would be, to leave it firſt to the determination of the Civil Judges, who, according to the Circumſtances of the Caſe, ought to ſend the Delinquents
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60718:72"/>
to the Eccleſiaſtical Court, there to undergo the Church-Cenſure. For, Chriſtian Soveraigns have an unqueſtionable Right to determine, what ſort of Miſdemeanors are puniſhable by the Civil Laws, and which of them come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cognizance of Eccleſiaſtical Courts; and conſequently, to decree, what ſort of Church-Cenſure ought to be laid upon the Delinquents, according to the different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Treſpaſs; which may be put in Execution by the Miniſters accordingly.

This however admits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of a Limitation; For herein are not comprehended theſe Points, which proceeding
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60718:73"/>
from Natural Religion, are alſo contained in the Chriſtian Doctrine, and all of them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a profound Reverence to be paid to the Supream BEING. For, it is beyond all queſtion, that thoſe that act againſt the very Dictates of Reaſon, ought to be ſubject to Civil Puniſhments, ſince they ſtrike at the very Foundation of Civil Societies: Such are Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, Blaſphemy, Profanation of the Sabbath; where nevertheleſs great care is to be taken, that a due difference be made betwixt the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral part of that Precept concerning the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, which is unalterable, and the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial part of it. Princes therefore at their firſt entrance into the Communion of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, might Lawfully deſtroy the Images and Temples of the Idols, and the Groves, and other Meeting-places dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their ſuperſtitious Worſhip. Neither can it be called in queſtion, but that Chriſtian Soveraigns have a Right to inflict Civil Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon ſuch as revile the whole Syſtem of the Chriſtian Religion, and ridicule the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Chriſtian Faith, at leaſt, they may Baniſh them the Country. But for the reſt, it is in vain to believe, that the true en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning of our Mind, and the inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſuch Articles of Faith as ſurpaſs our Underſtanding, can be procured by violent means, or temporal puniſhments. For, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing you force a Man to diſſemble his thoughts, to ſpeak contrary to what he conceives in his own Opinion, let his Confeſſion be never ſo formal, and his Geſtures never ſo well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and conformable to certain preſcribed

Rules, this has not the leaſt affinity with true Religion, unleſs he at the ſame time does feel an inward motion, and hearty compliance with what he profeſſes.

And, thoſe that embrace any Religion out of a Motive of Temporal Advantages, do plainly ſhew, that they have a greater Value for their own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And certainly, ſcarce any body, that has but common ſenſe, can perſwade himſelf, that ſuch a ſort of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip can be pleaſing to God Almighty. Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns being not conſtituted for Religion's ſake, they cannot under that colour exact from their Subjects a blind Obedience in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, it being unqueſtionable, that if Subjects ſhould blindfold follow the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of their Sovereign, they cannot by all his Authority be aſſured of their Salvation; from whence it is evident, that, in caſe any Subject be fully convinced, that he can out of the Holy Scripture diſcover any Errors, which are crept into the Church, even that by Law eſtabliſhed (eſpecially concerning any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Point of Faith) he neither can, nor ought to be hindered in his deſign by the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Authority, before his Reaſons be heard, and well debated in the preſence of

The Care of preſerving the Publick <note place="margin">What Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives belong to Sovereigns, as being Protectors of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility.</note> Peace, belonging in a moſt peculiar manner to Sovereigns, has furniſhed ſome with a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pretence to affirm, that ſince differences in Religion cauſe frequent Convulſions in the State, and it is to be deemed one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Happineſſes of a Government, if its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, in general, are of one Religion, all means, tho' never ſo violent, may be put in execution to extirpate theſe Differences in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. They alledge, that as much more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious our Souls are before our Bodies, the more Sovereigns are obliged to be watchful over them; and, that the true Love which a Sovereign bears to his Subjects, can never be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, than when he takes effectual care of their Salvation. Theſe, it muſt be confeſs'd, are very ſpecious Pretences, and have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had ſuch powerful influence over Princes, who were elſe naturally not inclined to Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60718:74"/>
that they have nevertheleſs by theſe plauſible Arguments been prevailed upon to aſſiſt with their Authority the cruel Deſigns of Prieſts. It will therefore not be beyond our ſcope, to make a ſtrict Enquiry what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ought to be made of theſe ſo ſpecious Reaſons in a well conſtituted Government. In the firſt place then, it is to be conſidered, that it has been foretold by our Saviour, that there ſhould always be in the Church Weeds amongſt the Wheat; that is to ſay, that there ſhould be falſe Doctrines raiſed in the Church; and theſe, according to the Commands of our Saviour, were not to be extirpated Root and Branch, but to be reſerved for the Day of Judgment. For a Sovereign that takes to ſuch violent courſes, may make a havock among his Subjects, which commonly proves equally pernicious to the Innocent and Guilty; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, he will find it impracticable quite to aboliſh all Errors and Differences in the Church. Never did any body ſhew a greater Love to Mankind than our Saviour, who ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed himſelf for our Salvation; Yet he made uſe of no other ways to propagate his Doctrine, than Teaching, when he might have commanded Twelve Legions of Angels to force Mankind to Obedience. How can a Prince be eſteemed to follow the Foot-ſteps of Chriſt, who makes ſuch profligate Wretches as the Dragoons his Apoſtles, for the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Subjects? That Pretence of the Love of Sovereigns toward their Subjects, let it be never ſo ſpecious, he ought not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that colour endeavour to ſubvert or alter
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60718:75"/>
the Method of propagating the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, according to the true Genius of the Chriſtian Religion. Beſides this, it is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to maintain the Publick Tranquility, that all the Subjects in general ſhould be of one Religion, or, which is the ſame in effect, the differences about ſome Points in Religion, conſidered barely as ſuch, are not the true cauſes of Diſturbances in a State; but the Heats and Animoſities, Ambition and perverted Zeal of ſome, who make theſe Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences their Tools, wherewith they often raiſe Diſturbances in the State. Such turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Spirits ought to be curbed, and care to be taken ſo to tye up their Hands, as that they want Power to influence the Minds of ſuch Subjects, as otherwiſe would be well ſatisfied, to enjoy peaceably a Liberty of Conſcience. And what ſhould move a Prince to diſturb his good Subjects meerly upon the ſcore of Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in Opinion, as long as they live quietly under his Goverment? For, ſuppoſing their Opinion to be erroneous, it is not at his, but their own Peril, and they alone muſt be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable for it. For, in my Opinion, Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns are entruſted with the Sword, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to diſſect Controverſies, as <hi>Alexander</hi> did with the <hi>Gordian</hi> Knot. But, that it may not be objected as if I intended to encourage all ſorts of Hereſies and Licentiouſneſs, I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that this is far different from my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but that on the contrary, it is to be wiſhed, and ought to be endeavoured, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure but one Faith and Religion in a State, and eſpecially ſuch a one as is abſolutely
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60718:75"/>
agreeable to the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, contained in the Holy Scripture; ſuch a one as cannot but contrbute towards the maintaining of the Publick Tranquility. For, I do not think, that all Uniformity in Religion is equally capable of procuring that Union; neither can the Pagan Religion, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans, Arians, Anabaptiſts,</hi> and that of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt</hi> himſelf, claim that Prerogative, but only the true and antient Religion contained in the Holy Scripture. For, this is only to be deemed the truly Antient Religion, which is derived from the pure and genuine Spring of the Primitive Chriſtian Religion. As among the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſuch only could boaſt to follow the true foot-ſteps of Antiquity, as proved their Doctrine out of the Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> All what degenerates from the Nature of its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Spring, tho' back'd by the Traditions of ſome Ages, being only to be look'd upon as an inveterate Error. Princes being then Protectors of the Publick Tranquility, have an Authority to inſpect what Canons are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Church, and to cauſe them to be examined according to the true Tenure of the Holy Scripture; and this care is not to be committed to the management of a few, who may perhaps be ſwayed by Faction or Intereſt, but to all ſuch as have a ſolid knowledge of the Holy Scripture. If every thing be found conſonant to its Rules, then may a Sovereign by his Authority Command this Doctrine to be Taught both in publick and private. But where there is not any Publick Form of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion eſtabliſhed in a Commonwealth, it is the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60718:76"/>
Sovereign's care, that one may be compoſed by the aſſiſtance of ſuch as are well verſed in the Holy Scripture, which being approved of by the general conſent of his Subjects, ought to be profeſſed by all, and all thoſe eſpecially, who pretend to the Miniſtry, are to be tyed up to its Rules. This form of Worſhip being once received,, a Prince may juſtly deny his Peotection to all ſuch as will not comply with it, unleſs he find it to be againſt the Common Intereſt of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal. If any one ſhould undertake to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict this Publick Form, eſpecially in ſuch Points as are the Heads of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, he ought to be admoniſhed to deſiſt, his Reaſons, if he has any, to be examined, and when convicted of his Error, to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced; if all this prove fruitleſs, he may lawfully be baniſhed. For, ſince, according to the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, we are to avoid the Converſation of Hereticks, it would be unreaſonable that a whole Society of Men ſhould fly from one or a few capricious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; So that he or they ought to ſeek out for a new Habitation, after they have been legally convicted of their Error; for fear they ſhould ſpread their erroneous Doctrines further than may be conſiſtent with the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Safety. But we allow no other Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſuch a caſe, except their Doctrine ſhould amount to Blaſphemy.</p>

Notwithſtanding what has been alledg'd <note place="margin">Concerning Tolerating of ſeveral Religions in a State.</note> there may be ſuch a juncture of Time &amp; Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that Sovereigns may, nay ought with a ſafe Conſcience to tolerate ſuch of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60718:76"/>
as are of a different Opinion from the Eſtabliſhed Religion. For, it may ſo happen, that the number of the Diſſenters is ſo great, as not to be expelled without great Prejudice to the State, and, not without danger to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, if they ſhould ſettle under another Government. For that common Saying of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Sort of Men, that 'tis better to have a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try lie waſte, than to have it inhabited by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, ſavours of Barbarity, if not Inhumanity. And a certain Prince who ſaid, that he would rather walk out of his Territories with nothing but a Staff in his hands, than to ſuffer it to be inhabited by Hereticks, may well paſs for one of the moſt bigotted Zealots in Chriſtendom. For the Doctrine of the Goſpel is not deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to civil Society, neither is thereby the leaſt Obligation laid upon Princes, to propagate Religion by violent and deſtructive means, or to undertake more in that behalf, than belongs to them as Protectors of the publick Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; they may therefore with a ſafe Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſupercede ſuch violent ways, by which the State either is endangered or weakned; eſpecially, ſince neither our Saviour did make uſe of them himſelf, nor commanded any thing like it to his Apoſtles. On the other hand, thoſe that expect to be tolerated in a State, ought by all means to endeavour to live peaceably and quietly, and as becomes good Subjects, they ought not to Teach any Doctrine which ſavours of Sedition and Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, or to ſuffer ſuch Principles to be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in their Congregations, as may prove deſtructive to the Prerogatives of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60718:77"/>
For, there is not the leaſt queſtion to be made, but Princes have a right to rout out ſuch as propagate theſe Doctrines, they having not the leaſt relation to Religion, but are like ſpots, wherewith ſome turbulen Heads beſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Chriſtian Religion. Beſides this, there is another duty incumbent to Sovereigns over a State, where more than one Religion is tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; <hi>viz.</hi> to keep a watchful eye over them, that the Diſſenting Parties do not break out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to extravagant Expreſſions about the Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Religion, theſe being the Fuel that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames them into Animoſities, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prove the ſpring of Factions, Troubles, and inteſtine Commotions. A much greater Obligation lies upon Sovereigns to tolerate Diſſenters, if they, when they firſt ſubmitted to the Government, had their Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience granted them by Contract; or have obtain'd it afterwards by certain Capitulations, any following Statutes, or by the fundmental Laws of the Land; all which ought to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred to Princes, and to be obſerved by them with the ſame Circumſpection, as they expect a due Obedience from their Subjects. No O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion concerning matter of Religion ought to be declared Erroneous, before it be duely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, and the Parties convicted, eſpecially if they are ready to prove the ſame out of the Fundamental Articles of the Chriſtian Faith; And great care is to be taken that ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion be not left to the Management of their Adverſaries, who being perhaps guided by ſelf Intereſt, oftentimes are both Accuſers and Judges. There are not a few Politicians, who
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60718:77"/>
are of opinion, that Sovereigns may with a ſafe Conſcience give Protection to their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; tho' of an erroneous Opinion, provided it be for the benefit of the Commonwealth; eſpecially if care be taken, that they do not draw away others into the ſame Error. For, ſuppoſing the eſtabliſhed Religion both in point of Doctrine and Morality, to excel all others, it is to be hoped that the Diſſenting Parties may be in time brought over to it, rather than to be feared, that they ſhould ſeduce others; Beſides, that it may contribute to the encreaſe of the Zeal and Learning of the eſtabliſhed Clergy, it being ſufficiently proved by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that in thoſe places and times, where and when no Religious Differences were in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the Clergy ſoon degenerated into Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Barbarity.</p>

For what can be more abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than to let Subjects ſuffer unjuſtly for their Faith in Chriſt, and that perhaps for no other reaſon, but, becauſe ſome others out of ſelf Intereſt, cannot agree with them in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And, if a Prince, who prompted by his own cruel Inclinations tyranniſes over his Subjects, is odious to all the World, how much more abominable appears a Prince, who acts the part of an Executioner, and is made an Inſtrument by others to fulfil their cruel
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60718:78"/>
Deſigns againſt their Fellow Subjects? All Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes therefore, as they tender their Conſciences, ought to avoid all manner of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamities in Matters of this Nature, which ought never to be undertaken, unleſs they be well inſtructed beforehand in every particular Point. A Prince ought not only to be ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, or rely entirely on what is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him by his Clergy, (tho' never ſo pious in outward appearance;) there being too many Inſtances to be given, that the beſt of Princes, by their own Inclinations, abhorring all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Cruelty, have, by the Inſtigation of over-zealous Clergy-Men, turn'd the moſt cruel Tyrants: We ſcarce ever read of any Prince, who undertook to decide Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in Phyſick, or other Sciences (except he had attained to a particular Knowledge in theſe Matters) and, why ſhould Sovereigns be too forward in deciding Religious Differences, which are of much greater Moment, (the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and temporal welfare of Millions of People do depend thereon) unleſs they be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well inſtructed in every thing that has any relation to it? And, ſince Princes very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſtow ſufficient Time and Pains in being fully inſtructed in Divinity, it is to be wiſhed, that they would be byaſſed by their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Underſtanding, rather than be influenc'd by the Opinions of others. As for an Inſtance, in thoſe Controverſies which are betwixt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> there are ſuch evident Signs, from whence it is a difficult matter for a Chriſtian Prince to diſcern, which of theſe two ought to be preferred before the other.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60718:78"/>
For, if it be conſidered, that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are ſo far from forbidding the reading of the holy Scripture to the Laity, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they exhort them to it, and make the Scriptures the Touchſtone of their Doctrine, and the true Judge of their Controverſies; That the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> truſting upon the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their own Cauſe, do not forbid the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Popiſh</hi> Authors, but allow them to be publickly ſold, as being confident, that the weakneſs of their Arguments cannot have any influence, even over an indifferent Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; it cannot but ſeem very ſtrange, why in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Laity is not allowed the reading of the holy Scripture, nay, that they leave no ſtone unturn'd, to ſuppreſs the Validity of the holy Scripture; ſo, that in thoſe places where the Inquiſition is in vogue, a Man may with leſs danger be guilty of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, Perjury, and other the moſt enormous Crimes, than to read and examine the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the holy Scripture. On the other hand, what a clamour do they make about Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Prerogatives of the Church, which Title they claim as belonging, in a moſt peculiar manner to themſelves, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſame is not allowed them by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they aſſume to themſelves the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of giving Judgment in their own Cauſe. It is very well worth the Conſideration of a Prince, that they will not allow our Books to be read among them, and eſpecially, how careful they are in keeping them from the Knowledge of Great Men, tho' belonging to the Communion of their Church. Who is
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60718:79"/>
ſo ignorant as not to know, what great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Obſtacles were to be ſurmounted before it could be obtained, that the <hi>Augſburgh</hi> Confeſſion was read to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> V. All which, taken together, are moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Proofs to any unbyaſſed Perſon, that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> act like Men, as relying upon the goodneſs of their Cauſe; but the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi> as miſtruſting themſelves, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if their Doctrine ſhould be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, according to the Tenure of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and out of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Wrttings, the ſame would ſcarce bear the Touchſtone. It may alſo be taken into conſideration, how far different the Intereſt of the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> Party is from that of the <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> For, tho' both Parties with equal Zeal in Publick pretend to the Honour of God, and the Truth of the Goſpel; and it is not to be denied, but that a great many among the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> are very Zealous for the ſame; nevertheleſs, if we duely conſider the Nature of Mankind in general, it may eaſily be ſuppoſed, that they aim at ſomething more; And, what this ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is, is eaſily diſcernable, if we make a due compariſon betwixt the Clergy of both Parties. Among the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> the greateſt part of the Clergy are ſo ſtinted in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, as to give them no opportunity of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in State; what Reſpect is paid them, is on the account of their Function as being Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, their power very ſeldom reaches beyond their Revenues, which are very moderate, and oftentimes very mean. Both their Perſons and Eſtates depend from the Authority of their
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60718:79"/>
Sovereigns, neither have they any where elſe to ſeek for Protection. On the contrary, in what Pomp and affluence of Fortune does the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy live! Unto what hight have they not exalted their Power in <hi>Europe!</hi> Have they not ſo ordered their Matters, as to be almoſt independant from the Civil Magiſtrates? What likelihood can there be in all this, that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſhould be as much concerned for a Temporal By-Intereſt as the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy? For, whereas, they firſt can expect no more than what is alloted them already, the latter have no leſs in view than vaſt Riches, and the Poſſeſſions of whole Kingdoms. All theſe Matters duely conſidered, may be convincing Proofs, that all the Clamour which the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi> Clergy makes againſt the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> is of the ſame nature with that of <hi>Demetrius</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> when he exclaimed againſt St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Love and Meekneſs being the products of the Chriſtian Faith; the Cruelties of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy exerciſed againſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ought to be ſuſpected by Princes, and ſerve them as a forewarning; what good is to be expected from thoſe that proſecute with ſo much Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity all ſuch, as oppoſe their Pride and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition? After the Perſecutions were ceaſed in the Primitive Church, the <hi>Arians</hi> were the firſt, who ſhew'd their teeth to the Chriſtians; But they would have bluſhed for ſhame, if they ſhould have attempted to propagate their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by force of Arms, and ſuch other cruel Perſecutions as are now in vogue among the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy. If we were not ſufficiently convinced, that the Spirit of Envy is not the

               <p>§. 52. Laſtly, Since Sovereigns ought to be <note place="margin">Sovereigns are often encroached upon in their rights under a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text.</note> jealous of their own Prerogatives, they may without Injuſtice make an Enquiry, whether the Proteſtant or the Popiſh Religion be moſt encroaching upon their Authority, and which of theſe two be moſt conſiſtent with the Civil Government. For whenever the Civil Power bears any diminution under a Religious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, it is then high time for Sovereigns to look about them, to examine upon what Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation theſe Pretenſions are built; it being evident, that Civil Goverment was introduced before the Chriſtian Religion, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought plainly to be demonſtrated, how Civil Authority came to be diminiſhed by the Chriſtian Religion. Now, if we look into the Conſtitution of the Popiſh Clergy, it is manifeſt, that by many ſteps and degrees, and by various Artifices and Intrigues, they have at laſt patch'd up a Potent State of their
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60718:80"/>
own; and that their Supream Head, for theſe many Ages paſt, is poſſeſs'd of great Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Acts as a Sovereign; and, not only this, but alſo obtrudes his Authority upon all ſuch as profeſs the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion. For, they don't think it ſufficient that the whole Clergy have their dependance from him, but he pretends to an Abſolute Authority of determining all Matters of Faith, by which means he is ſure to guide the Minds of the People where ever he pleaſes. If any thing in the World is deſtructive to the Civil Powers, it muſt of neceſſity be this, when a Party in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting their Territories, diſown their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction and depending from a Foreign Power; deny the Authority of their Natural Prince over them, or at leaſt acknowledge it no longer than they think it convenient. If Neighbouring States are commonly the moſt jealous of one another, muſt it not be look'd upon as a great Solociſm of State, to permit ſuch as depend from a Foreign Juriſdiction to abide in the Commonwealth? It is next door to take Foreign Gariſons into our Forts, or to allow a Foreign Force to Encamp in the midſt of our Dominions. And this Miſchief ſeems to be the more pernicious, when the Revenues, by which the Grandeur of this Eccleſiaſtical State is maintained, are ſqueezed out of the Subjects of any Prince, and the beſt part of his Territories exhauſted; whereas on the contrary, theſe Leeches are not only freed from all manner of Taxes, but alſo pretend to a Legiſlative Authority, ſo as to inflict Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the Subjects, and to Abſolve them
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60718:81"/>
from their Allegiance due to their Sovereigns. I cannot ſee how Princes, without great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Commonweal, can allow the leaſt Authority over their Perſons, to the Clergy; For, if the Prince and they happen to jarr together, the poor Subjects pay for it with a Vengeance, when they are to ſerve two Maſters of a contrary ſide at one time; and the Taxes muſt fall the heavier upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, where the Clergy are exempted from all Contributions. Laſtly, is it not a heavy Burthen to the Subjects, to be ſubject both to an Eccleſiaſtical and Temporal Juriſdiction? The former being generally the moſt ſevere; as is moſt evident in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> where the Courts of Inquiſition are in vogue. It being therefore beyond all queſtion, that all theſe things are practiſed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, but in no wiſe by the Proteſtants, ſuch Princes, as, being miſled by the Popiſh Clergy, endeavour to extirpate their Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Subjects, Act not only contrary to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, but even againſt the very Dicrates of right Reaſon. What has been objected by ſome, <hi>viz.</hi> That Proteſtants have not been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together free from the imputation of raiſing Diſturbances in the State, and having joined with a Foreign Power, ſcarce deſerves an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; For, this is not to be imputed to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it ſelf, but rather, to ſome dangerous Juncture, and other Circumſtances, which often prove the occaſion of dangerous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions in a State; Or elſe, the Papiſts have firſt begun the Dance, and what Wonder is it, if ſome Proteſtants, to avoid their cruel
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60718:81"/>
Deſigns againſt them, have endeavoured to repel the Fury of their Adverſaries; and when they found themſelves inſufficient, have ſought for Aid by Foreign Princes. For, as it is the greateſt piece of Injuſtice to compel Subjects by force of Arms to any Religion, ſo theſe may juſtly defend their Religion by force of Arms, eſpecially if they live under a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where they have a Right belonging to them of Protecting their Liberties againſt any Invaders.</p>

Laſt of all, it very well deſerves to <note place="margin">Concerning the Right of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> make an Enquiry who it is that has the Power in the Commonwealth to amend ſuch Errors and Abuſes, as are crept into the Church, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Point of Doctrine, Morality, or Church-Government? Or, which turns to the ſame Account, who has the Right of Reformation? Where firſt of all it is unqueſtionable, that there is no occaſion of a Reformation, where the Clergy, upon Admonition, deſiſt from theſe Abuſes; like as when a Creditor, upon Summons, is paid by his Debtor, ought to ſupercede his Action againſt him. But, put the caſe, that the Clergy either abſolutely refuſe, or from time to time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract to deſiſt from ſuch Abuſes, ſo that there is but two ways left to be choſen; either pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to ſubmit to their capricious Humour, or elſe certain Perſons in the State, being damnified by theſe Abuſes, have a Right and Power to controul their Extravagancies. Thoſe that maintain the firſt Poſition, muſt prove, that the Clergy has been inveſted with ſuch an unlimited Power by God Almighty, to impoſe

But, becauſe it would ſavour of too much Impudence to pretend to the firſt, it lies then at their Door to prove, that the Clergy, and their Supream Head, did never err, either in Point of Doctrine, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, or Church-Government; All which having been ſufficiently demonſtrated to the contrary, by the conſent of ſeveral Chriſtian Nations. We are of Opinion, that when any Abuſes are crept into the Church, which are prejudicial to the Commonwealth, or the Authority of Sovereigns, theſe, by vertue of their Sovereign Right and Prerogative, have a Power to aboliſh and reform all ſuch matters as interfere with the Publick Good and Civil Authority. At the ſame time, it cannot be denyed, but that in a caſe of ſuch moment it may be very convenient to acquain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And, if eſpecially, the Rights of the People are inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by theſe Abuſes, this Reformation ought to be undertaken with the knowledge and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Subjects. It may be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that by ſuch a Reformation Diviſions are
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60718:82"/>
raiſed in the Church. But this is to be look'd upon as a matter of no great Weight; ſuch a Diviſion being not to be imputed to thoſe that rectifie ſuch Errors, but to thoſe that obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately refuſe to return into the right Path, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There is nothing more obvious out of the antient Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Hiſtory, than that ſuch as were plainly convicted of an Error, uſed to be excluded from the Communion of the Church. But ſuch as begin a Reformation upon a good and legal Account, can under no Colour whatſoever be accuſed of Schiſm or Rebellion. For, thoſe are Rebels, who by forcible Ways endeavour to withdraw themſelves from the Allegiance due to their lawful Sovereign: Whereas all ſuch as free themſelves from Abuſes unjuſtly impoſed upon them, without their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or any Divine Authority, rather deſerve to be ſtiled defenders of their own Liberty and Conſcience; eſpecially, if theſe Abuſes and Errors are dangerous to their Souls. For, no Teacher, no Biſhop, no Convention what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, was ever inveſted with an abſolute Power of domineering over Chriſtians at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſo that no Remedy ſhould be left againſt their Uſurpation. It cannot therefore but be look'd upon as a great piece of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Party, when they aſſume to themſelves wholly and entirely the Title of the Church, with excluſion to all others, that are not of the ſame Communion. For, they either muſt pretend their Church to be the Univerſal, or elſe a particular Church By the Univerſal Church, is, according to the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60718:83"/>
Tenure of the Holy Scripture, underſtood the whole multitude of the Believers, whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſperſed in the World, whoſe Union conſiſts in this, That they acknowledge one God, one Redeemer, one Baptiſm, one Faith and Eternal Salvation; from whence only are excluded ſuch as pretend to diſſolve this Union; that is, who deny the true God, and his Son Chriſt, and who do not agree with the very Fundamental Principles of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. This is the true Catholick Church, not the Pope with his Eccleſiaſticks and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, who impoſe their Authority upon Chriſtendom. And, ſince thoſe that, for weighty Reaſons have withdrawn themſelves from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> may and do believe a true Baptiſm, a true God and Father, a Faith agreeable to the Holy Scripture, it is evident that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is not to be taken for the Univerſal Church; and that a Chriſtian may be a Member of the true Catholick Church, in a right ſenſe, notwithſtanding that he never was in the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, or, upon better Conſideration, has freed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from its Abuſes and Errors. But the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Religion, conſidered as a particular Church, as it ought to be, (tho', if we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel the bottom of its modern Conſtitution, it will eaſily appear, that the whole frame of that Church is not ſo much adapted to the Rules of a Chriſtian Congregation, as to a Temporal State; where, under a Religious pretext, the chief aim is to extend its Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty over the greateſt part of <hi>Europe)</hi> thoſe, that have withdrawn themſelves from that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60718:83"/>
Communion, are no more to be counted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, than our Modern Philoſophers are to be taken for Fools and Madmen, becauſe they differ in Opinion from <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> For, all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, who adhere to the true Faith, are, in regard of their Head Jeſus Chriſt, of an equal degree, and aim all at the ſame End. And Chriſt having given this Promiſe to all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; <hi>That where two or three were gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi>

What the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> alledge for themſelves out of the Apoſtolical Creed, is ſo full of abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, that it contradicts it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> out of theſe words: <hi>I believe one Holy, Catholick, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Church;</hi> For, except they could cajole us into a belief that theſe words imply as much as to ſay: There is but one true Church upon Earth, which is the <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> there being no other beſides that, I cannot ſee what Inference can be drawn from thence to their Advantage; Beſides, that the very ſenſe of the words contradict this Interpretation, if Reaſon, the Holy Scripture, and Experience it ſelf did not ſufficiently convince us to the contrary. It is beyond contradiction, that there is but one true Church upon Earth, there being but one God, one Chriſt, one Baptiſm, and one Faith; But, concerning one Point, many Errors and Abuſes may be committed. Neither have the Popiſh Party any reaſon to brag of a particular Holineſs, eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe matters, wherein they differ from the Proteſtants. The word <hi>Catholick,</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:60718:84"/>
relates here to a Doctrine, not to a Sovereign State, whoſe Authority is to be Univerſal over Chriſtendom, ſo that that Church is to be eſteemed a Catholick Church, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains every particular Point of Doctrine in the true ſenſe, as they are propoſed in the Holy Scripture; And thoſe are called Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who only profeſs ſome particular Points out of the Holy Writ, (for ſuch as abſolutely reject it, are counted Infidels and Reprobates) but either deny, or explain the reſt in a wrong and perverted ſenſe. How can the Popiſh Clergy therefore aſſume the Title of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, before they have, and that without contradiction, proved every Point of their Faith out of the Holy Scripture? Or, exclude us Proteſtants from that Title, till they have proved that our Doctrine is contrary to it? Laſtly, It is called the Apoſtolical Church, as being founded upon the Doctrine of the Apoſtles. And the true Church loſes nothing of its intrinſick Value, whether it has been planted by the Apoſtles, or whether the Apoſtolical Doctrine has been tranſmitted to them by others.</p>

                  </gap>hoſe Salvation cannot abſolutely be committed to any Body elſe; and, a Chriſtian, in Matters of Faith, being not altogether to rely upon his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign or the Clergy, (at leaſt no farther than their Doctrine is congruous with the holy Scripture.) It is undeniable, that Subjects may ſeparate themſelves from the Communion of that Church, which is proſeſſed by their Sovereign and Clergy, provided they can make it evidently appear, that ſuch a Church is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with groſs Abuſes, and dangerous Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. For, the Church is a Colledge, whoſe Members are not kept in Union by any Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Power, but by the Union of the Faith; and, whoſoever relinquiſhes that, he diſſolves the ſacred Tye of the Believers. Beſides that, it is not abſolutely neceſſary for our Salvation, that the Church be compoſed of a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but the ſame may be obtained, either by a greater or leſſer Number of the Believers. Neither can this Separation prove in the leaſt prejudicial to the Sovereign Authority, it being ſuppoſed, that thoſe who have ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated themſelves adhere to the true pure Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, free from all Poiſon, and Principles dangerous or prejudicial to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. For, civil Society was not inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60718:85"/>
for Religion's ſake; neither does the Church of Chriſt participate of the nature of a Temporal State; and therefore a Prince that embraces the Chriſtian Faith, does not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by acquire an abſolute Sovereignty over the Church or Mens Conſciences. So, that, if, notwithſtanding this Separation, the Subjects pay due Allegiance to their Prince in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Affairs, there is no reaſon ſufficient which can oblige him to trouble them meerly upon the ſcore of their Conſciences. For, what loſs is it to the Prince, whether his Subjects are of the ſame Religion with himſelf, or of uno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Or, (which was ſuppoſed before) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did maintain the ſame Errors, as he does? The caſe indeed, would be quite differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, if they ſhould endeavour to withdaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their Allegiance, to ſet up a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Society without his Conſent; tho' it is undeniable, that there are ſome Caſes of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, when this civil Tye or Allegiance may be diſſolved, as for Inſtance; when Subjects, for want of ſufficient Protection from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Prince, are ſo hardly preſſed upon by a more Potent Enemy, that they are forc'd to ſubmit to his Power. And granted the Power of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns in the Church to be much greater, than in effect it is, Subjects are nevertheleſs bound to take care of their Souls, whoſe Salvation is to be preferr'd before all other things, in regard of which they may ſeparate themſelves from an Eſtabliſhed Religion, provided they are convinced of its Errors. For, that Subject who ſacrifices his Life for his Prince, does doubtleſs a glorious Action; but what Prince
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60718:85"/>
can be ſo unreaſonable, as to expect that his Subjects ſhould Sacrifice their Souls to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil for his ſake. That Prince therefore who does trouble his faithful Subjects for no other reaſon, but becauſe they cannot conform to his Opinion (eſpecially if they can maintain theirs out of the Holy Scripture) commits an Act of Injuſtice; Nay, I cannot ſee how he can with Juſtice force them out of his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories. It is true, he may refuſe to receive Hereticks into his Dominions, unleſs it be for Reaſons of State; Neither can a true Believer take it amiſs, if he is not permitted to ſettle in a Commonwealth govern'd by Hereticks. For, the Right of Naturalization belongs to Sovereigns, which they may refuſe and give to whom they think it convenient. But, as it is certainly the greateſt Injuſtice in the World, to force an in-born Natural Subject, who has ſettled all his Fortunes in a Commonwealth, meerly for his Religion's ſake, without being convicted of his Error, out of his Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to the great detriment and danger of himſelf and his Family. So, if a Subject in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines voluntarily to leave his Native Country, either to avoid the Frowns of his Prince, or the hatred of the Clergy and Common People, and to ſerve God with more freedom accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own Conſcience, it ought not to be refuſed by his Sovereign. I remember there is a certain Proverb uſed among the <hi>Germans,</hi> viz. <hi>He that Commands the Country, Commands Religion.</hi> But this cannot be applied to the Princes of the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Religion, who cannot lay any Claim to it, it being evident
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60718:86"/>
that the Popiſh Clergy do not allow any ſuch thing to theſe Princes; And, as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Proteſtant Eſtates of <hi>Germany,</hi> it cannot be denied, but that they made uſe of this Pretenſion againſt the Emperor at the time of the Reformation, which however ought to be thus interpreted; That they denied the Emperor to have any Power of intermedling in the Affairs relating to their own Dominions, not, that only they claim'd it as belonging to the Rights of Sovereignty to impoſe any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, tho' never ſo falſe, upon their Subjects; notwithſtanding all which, there are not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Examples, that Princes have acted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to this Proverb with their Subjects. A Prince, who troubles his faithful Subjects meerly upon the ſcore of Religion, commits a groſs Error; no Chriſtian Prince being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to propagate his Religion by forcible means; provided his Subjects ſtand firm to their Allegiance to him, he being not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in particular for their Religion. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taken notice of without aſtoniſhment, how both in former times and our Age, ſome Princes, who were naturally not enclined to Cruelty, having in other reſpects given great Proofs of their Clemency, yet have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to raiſe the moſt horrid Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt their Subjects, barely upon the ſcore of Religion.

There having not been wanting, both in the laſt and our Age, Men eminent for their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who have with very ſolid Arguments op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Tyranny of the firſt, it is but reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for us, to take heed, that ſince we have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped the danger of <hi>Scylla,</hi> we may not be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by <hi>Charybdis.</hi> For, as ſcarce any body that is in his right Senſes can go about to deny, that the Sovereign Power ows its original either to God, or the general Conſent of the People; So it is a matter mutually advantageous both to the Prince and Subjects, to underſtand, how far this Power is limited in the State, that the firſt may not tranſgreſs their due Bounds, and, inſtead of being Fathers of their Subjects, prove their moſt dangerous Enemies. <hi>Adrian Houtuyn</hi> a Civilian in <hi>Holland,</hi> having in a Treatiſe, called, <hi>A Political Epitomy,</hi> inſerted ſeveral Aſſertions tending to the latter of theſe two Extremes, and it having been obſerved of late, that this Book has been recommended by ſome <hi>Doctors</hi> in the Law, to the great detriment of young Students; I thought it not amiſs to make ſome Animadverſions upon his LXIII, and following SECTIONS, which may ſerve as a Guide to the younger Sort, leſt they, under the Cloak of aſſerting the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of Sovereigns, may be miſlead into the latter of theſe Extremes, and attribute that to the Prince, which God has reſerved as his own Prerogative, and thus, irrecoverably, play the Prodigal with their own Liberty and Property.</p>
            <p>This Author ſpeaking concerning the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of Princes, <hi>Sect.</hi> LXIII, runs on thus:
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60718:88"/>
               <hi>He has an uncontroul'd Power over all External, Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, which are not determined in the Holy Scripture.</hi> He alledges for a Reaſon, becauſe that Power is granted to Sovereigns at the ſame time when Subjects ſubmitted, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Fortunes to their Diſpoſal. But it ought to be taken into Conſideration, that certain Matters belonging to the external Exerciſe of Religious Worſhip have ſo ſtrict an Union with the internal Part, that, if the firſt be not diſpoſed in a manner agreeable to this inſeparable Tye, the latter muſt of neceſſity undergo ſuch Alterations, as are inconſiſtent with its Nature. And, ſince Mr. <hi>Houtuyn</hi> do's not leave the internal Part to the Diſpoſal of Sovereigns, how can the exterior Worſhip be ſubmitted to their meer Pleaſure, conſidering this ſtrict Union betwixt them? Beſides this <hi>General Submiſſion,</hi> he ſpeaks of admits of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, in regard of that End, for which Civil Societies were Inſtituted, which is, the mutual defence againſt Violences: From whence it is evident, that there are certain Matters, belonging to every private Perſon, derived from the State of natural Freedom, which were not abſolutely left to the Diſpoſal of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns, at leaſt, no further than they were neceſſary to obtain that End. Religion having not any relation to this End, it is not to be imagined, that Subjects did ſubmit their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the arbitrary Pleaſure of Sovereigns. And, it being unqueſtionable, that Subjects may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe certain Acts belonging to them by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of an inherent Right, derived from the free State of Nature, and independent from
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60718:88"/>
their Sovereigns, it may rationally be conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that, when Subjects did ſubmit themſelves, in Matters of Religion, to their Sovereigns, it was done with this Suppoſition, that both the Prince and Subjects were of one and the ſame Religion; and that the external Exerciſe of Religious Worſhip was not left to the Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of the firſt, any further, than in ſuch Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as are indifferent in regard of the internal Part of it. What is alledged concerning the the <hi>maintaining a good Order, and avoiding of Confuſion,</hi> it is to be obſerved, that this is not the main End, for which Civil Societies were Inſtituted, nor has it any relation to it, but only thus far, as it may be inſtrumental to maintain the Publick Tranquility.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>N.</hi> 2. It is to be obſerved, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Prieſts have a dependance from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Power in certain Reſpects belonging to its Juriſdiction, this does not involve Religion (conſidered as ſuch) under the ſame Subjection. The following words ought alſo to be taken notice of: <hi>A Chriſtian Prince commands over the Church, as being a Colledge, and repreſenting one ſingle Perſon in the Commonwealth. The Church, thus conſidered, is a Civil Society or Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, founded upon the Publick Authority and Power, and ought to be regarded, as being in the ſame condition with other Colledges and Bodies Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick; and in this Senſe a King is the Head of the Church in his Dominions.</hi> Whoever will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the real difference betwixt the Church and Commonwealth, muſt needs find as many Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, as there are words here. For, becauſe a Prince has the Sovereign Juriſdiction in a
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60718:89"/>
Commonweath, conſiſting of Chriſtian Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; no inference is to be made, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he may, in the ſame degree, exerciſe his Sovereignty in the Church, as in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and that in the ſame Senſe, he may be called, <hi>The Supream Head of the Church, as of the Commonwealth.</hi> 'Tis true, the Church is a Society, but not a Body Politick, founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Publick Authority, but owes it Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to a higher Principle, having not, like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Colledges, its dependency from the State. What is alledged out of <hi>Titus,</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3. 20, 22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 3, 4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 14. is ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſrepreſented to evince, that Eccleſiaſtical Matters are dependent from the abſolute Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Sovereigns. What Follows might alſo very well deſerve ſome Animadverſions, if it were not beyond our ſcope at preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>N.</hi> 13. It is a groſs Error, That, <hi>as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this Sovereign Power in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs,</hi> he attributes to them, <hi>the Titles of Paſtors, Miniſters, Heralds of God, Biſhops, Prieſts, and Apoſtles.</hi> Pray, with what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and with what ſenſe? For, the Duty belonging to Sovereigns, which entitles them to the name of <hi>being the Guardians of both Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Decalogue, and of being the Foſter-Fathers and Defenders of the Church,</hi> is of a far different Nature from what he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate here. And, if it be not to be left to the abſolute Judgment of the Clergy it ſelf, with excluſion of the reſt of the Members of the Church, to determine in Eccleſiaſtical Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, what is agreeable to the Word of God, how can this Judgment belong to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60718:89"/>
alone, without allowing a ſhare to the reſt of the Members of the Church?</p>
            <p>Theſe words in the §. LXIV. <hi>Each Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign may eſtabliſh what Religion he pleaſes in his Dominions,</hi> ought not to be let paſs by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſevere Correction. The Reaſon alledged is very frivolous: <hi>Becauſe all Publick and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Actions depend from the Publick Authority.</hi> Is this your Aſſertion, good Mr. <hi>Houtuyn,</hi> that Princes may impoſe what Religion they pleaſe upon their Subjects, and by their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Authority make it the eſtabliſh'd Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, with excluſion to all others, who, if not complying, muſt, forſooth, ſly the Country? What Religion they pleaſe, do you ſay! the the Pagan, Falſe, Fictious, or Superſtitious, it matters not which. From whence, pray, was this Power derived to Sovereigns? Not certainly from God, except you can ſhew us a Divine Authority for it. Not from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent of thoſe that entred into Civil Societies; Commonwealths not being inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for Religion's ſake, and of a later date; beſides, that ſuch a Power is not requiſite for the attaining that end, for which Civil Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were eſtabliſh'd. Neither is it left to the bare pleaſure of any Perſon, tho' conſidered as in the Natural ſtate of Freedom, to profeſs what Religion he pleaſes: But, ſuppoſing it was, no Inference can be made from thence, that the ſame may be forc'd upon others. The diſtinction he makes betwixt the <hi>internal and external Religion,</hi> muſt alſo be taken with a great deal of Circumſpection, leſt ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might perſwade themſelves, that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60718:90"/>
what Religion a Man profeſſes in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew, provided he be ſatisfied as to the internal part of it. Furthermore, it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely falſe, that all Publick Actions, that is, every thing done in Publick in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, owes its Original to the Sovereign Power; there being ſeveral things to be done by Subjects in publick, depending meerly from that Liberty belonging to them in the Natural ſtate of Liberty, or from God's Command, or from a certain Power granted to them by God Almighty.</p>
            <p>It is no leſs falſe, That all exterior Actions depend from the Civil Authority; For, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. <hi>Houtuyn</hi>'s Opinion, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Divinity, and the Confeſſion of Faith, as comprehended in a certain form, are to be reckoned among thoſe exterior Actions. Mr. <hi>Houtuyn</hi> is much in the wrong, when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to draw an Inference from thence; that, becauſe it belongs to Sovereigns to take care, that their Subjects may be well inſtructed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning what Opinion they ought to have of God, as the Eſtabliſher of Juſtice; they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have a Right of diſpoſing (in an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way) of revealed Religion, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare any Religion whatſoever, which pretends to Revelation, the Eſtabliſh'd Religion in the Commonwealth. It is a much groſſer Miſtake yet, when he aſſerts: That <hi>any Religion eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd in a State, tho' never ſo falſe, contributes to the Publick Tranquility of that Commonwealth.</hi> It is poſſible that a Religion defective in ſome Points, may nevertheleſs lead People into the way of Salvation; but thoſe that contain falſe
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60718:90"/>
Doctrines of God and his Attributes, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of producing that Effect. The Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tranquility, founded upon ſuch falſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, will be very unſtable, and may with more eaſe, or at leaſt with the ſame conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency be obtained by the true Doctrine; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be taken into conſideration, that, tho' it be poſſible that ſuch Impoſtures may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile the giddy-headed Multitude, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not always paſs for currant among Men of a ſound Underſtanding: It is to be remembred, that the Southſayers at <hi>Rome</hi> cannot forbear laughing, when they meet another of the ſame Profeſſion. We muſt beg Mr. <hi>Houtuyn</hi>'s Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, if we queſtion his Authority, when he pretends to perſwade us: That <hi>Faith,</hi> which he is pleaſed to call <hi>every ones private Religion, independent from any Temporal Power,</hi> will not be impaired by a Man's profeſſing any other Religion, eſtabliſhed by the Sovereign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and he leaves it to the diſcretion of thoſe Civil Governours, which of all Religions they will be pleaſed to eſtabliſh in their Dominions, whether that of the <hi>Japoneſes,</hi> of the <hi>Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Mahometans, Jews,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and among all thoſe that pretend to the Chriſtian Name, ſuch a one as may be moſt agreeable to their own Fancy. I much queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will meet with many Tools, that will take his Word for it. A great part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom did look upon it as a thing inſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould ſet up for the great Arbitrator of Chriſtendom in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters relating to the Chriſtian Faith, tho' his Pretences did not reach further than to force
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60718:91"/>
one Religion upon the World, which he knew was moſt likely to turn to his own Advantage: But now it ſeems it has pleaſed God, that Sovereigns ſhould be inveſted with a Power of eſtabliſhing any Religion at pleaſure; and it being beyond queſtion, that there are ſeveral Religions which have not the leaſt relation to one another, they may, with the ſame Right, at ſeveral times, declare, ſeveral diſtinct Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, nay, even thoſe that are quite oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to one another, the eſtabliſh'd Religion, and nevertheleſs every one of theſe muſt be accepted, forſooth, as the true Religion. The next Conſequence will be, that Sovereigns, having a Right of defending and altering the eſtabliſh'd Religion, and to puniſh ſuch as treſpaſs againſt it, one Prince will have no more Right to cheriſh and maintain one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but his Succeſſors may, with the ſame Right, aboliſh it, and puniſh ſuch of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as adhere to it. So that according to the Doctrine of Mr. <hi>Houtuyn</hi>'s Goſpel, the eſtabliſh'd Religion will be ſettled upon the ſame Foundation with ſome Statutes, which may be enacted and repeal'd by Sovereigns at pleaſure.</p>
            <p>In §. LXV. He entirely, and without limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, aſcribes to the Prince the Power of <hi>Conſtituting Miniſters of the Goſpel, in the ſame manner as if they were Miniſters of the State.</hi> But in the Commonwealth of the <hi>Jews,</hi> regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated according to God's own Inſtitution, no ſuch Power was granted to their Kings; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had the Apoſtles themſelves, (tho' the moſt general Teachers that ever were (as
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60718:91"/>
being ſent to Preach the Goſpel to all the World) their Authority of Teaching from any Temporal Sovereigns. Neither can it be proved, that the Church, at the time, when Sovereigns firſt embraced the Chriſtian Faith, did transferr this Power of conſtituting Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel, without limitation, to thoſe Princes; tho' at the ſame time it is not to be denied, but that Sovereigns have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſhare in it. His Argument taken from <hi>the care Parents ought to have of the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Children,</hi> does not reach to what he pretends to prove; for, ſays he, Princes being the Publick Fathers of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; <hi>it belongs to their Princely Office, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the Eternal Salvation of their Subjects.</hi> For, beſides that, the Title of <hi>Father of the Commonwealth</hi> is a Metaphorical Expreſſion, the Fatherly and the Regal Office depend from a quite different Principle, and the care to be taken of Children of a tender Age, is of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature with that which ought to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for the Safety of a whole People; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were Sovereigns inveſted with the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Authority to enable them to procure Eternal Salvation to their Subjects, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving preſcribed other ways and means for the obtaining of it. It cannot be denied, but that a Prince muſt not be regardleſs of this Care, nevertheleſs ought the ſame not to reach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its due Bounds, but muſt be effected by ſuch Methods as are approved of in the Holy Scripture, and ſuit with the true Genius of the Chriſtian Religion; Wherefore, it is in vain to attribute to Sovereigns a Power of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60718:92"/>
obtruding any Religion, at pleaſure, upon their Subjects; it being beyond queſtion, that not all Religions are conducing to obtain Eternal Salvation. So <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, did not impoſe upon his Children what Religion he thought moſt convenient, but he charged them to walk in the ways of the Lord, ſuch as were manifeſted to them in the Holy Scripture. What St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. is very well worth taking notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> That the chief care of the Supream Governours ſhall be, ſo to Rule over their Subjects, that they may live under them, not only honeſtly, but piouſly; this being the way to Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is to be obſerved, that thoſe Princes, for whom the Apoſtle enjoined the Chriſtians to pray, being Pagans, made but little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Piety, eſpecially of that belonging to the Chriſtians; but it was thought ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the Chriſtians to enjoy the common Benefit of the Publick Tranquility under their Protection, the reſt being left to their own care. So we read that the Poet's enjoyment of his Muſes, was owing to <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi>'s Protection; nevertheleſs the Emperor did not concern himſelf about the Rules of Poetry. Furthermore, it is a very groſs way of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when he Aſſerts: That, <hi>the Commonwealth and Church are both one and the ſame thing under a Chriſtian Prince, whoſe Subjects alſo profeſs the Chriſtian Religion, the only difference being in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their different Qualifications: They being in the Commonwealth to be conſidered as they are Subjects, in the Church as Believers.</hi> It ſeems, Mr. <hi>Houtuyn</hi> looks upon that Difference to be
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60718:92"/>
of little moment, which ariſes from divers Moral Qualifications, and includes different Obligations, and is founded upon another Legal Principle. It is confeſs'd, that in ſuch a caſe where the Head is not differing in his Natural Conſtitution from the Rights and Power belonging to him, the reſt of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, tho' differently conſidered under divers Qualifications, are nevertheleſs to be look'd upon as one and the ſame Society. As for inſtance: If a Prince puts himſelf at the Head of all his Subjects upon an Expedition, theſe, tho' they may be conſidered either as Soldiers or Subjects, yet do not differ in any Eſſential Part; As for Example: The People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when going upon their Expedition under the Conduct of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> was the very ſame that afterwards, under his Protection, enjoyed and inhabited the Country of <hi>Canaan.</hi> But the Church and Commonwealth, tho' compoſed out of the ſelf-ſame Perſons, do not only differ in their very Foundation, but alſo a Sovereign cannot claim the ſame Right and Name of being the Supream Head of the Church in the ſame ſenſe, as he is the Supream Governour of the State. For, in the latter he exerciſes his Authority without controul, being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to no body; But, the Head of the Church is Chriſt, who Rules it by his Word, announ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to us by the Teachers of the Church; ſo, that a Sovereign cannot as much as claim the Right of being Chriſt's Vicegerent in the Church; And, on the other hand, tho' it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>That all Power is given unto him in Heaven, and upon Earth,</hi> nevertheleſs it
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60718:93"/>
cannot be ſaid of him, to be, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Head of Civil Societies, as of the Church. The next following Aſſertion runs thus: <hi>Where the whole Commonwealth is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed out of Chriſtians, the Church is a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Believers in the Commonwealth.</hi> But, where all Subjects are Chriſtians, the Church is nevertheleſs nothing elſe than a Colledge in the Commonwealth. But what he alledges of the Church being ſometimes taken in the ſame ſenſe with the Commonwealth, is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely falſe. For the words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in <hi>Acts</hi> 14 23. and thoſe in <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> are no Synoms; but the latter is to be underſtood thus: In all the Towns and Cities, where there was any Chriſtian Church. The Inference he would make from the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Function, and the Adminiſtration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, being both included in one Government, is to no purpoſe; both of them owing their Off-ſpring to that End for which Civil Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were inſtituted, which is not the ſame in the Church; and Sovereigns are entruſted with the Sword of War and Juſtice, not with the Miniſterial Function of Preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. From whence it comes, that Generals and Judges are ſubordinate to the Princely Office, but not the Miniſters of the Goſpel, they being (barely conſidered as ſuch) not properly Miniſters of the Prince and State, but Miniſters of Chriſt and the Church. He ſays further; <hi>That the aſſignation of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Function does not appertain to the Internal part of Religion.</hi> But if Faith comes from hearing, and no body can believe, without
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60718:93"/>
being inſtructed; it is undeniable, that thoſe that Preach the Goſpel, have a ſhare in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part of Religion, they being to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the Inſtruments, by the help of whom, the Goſpel, and conſequently the Faith, is conveyed to their Auditors. It is falſe, when he aſſerts, That Sovereigns, tho' no Chriſtians, have a Right of conſtituting Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>their Right is the ſame.</hi> But a Prince, who makes not Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith, tho' he has Chriſtian Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects under his Juriſdiction, and allows them the free Exerciſe of their Religion, has never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs not the leaſt Power over their Church, as being no Member of it. It is no leſs falſe, what he ſays, that ſince Princes are become Chriſtians, the Vocation of Miniſters does no more depend from the Church; <hi>Juſt as a Man, by ſubmitting himſelf under another Juriſdiction, is no more at his own diſpoſal.</hi> For, a Prince by becoming a Member of the Church, does there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not make himſelf Maſter of that Church, but rather ſubmits to the Obedience of Chriſt, the Head of the Church; and therefore does not incroach all its Rights to himſelf, but only can claim his ſhare as ſuch, unleſs a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Church ſhould voluntarily ſurrender its Rights, as far as it lies in its power, to the Sovereign. And I ſee no reaſon, why the Church may not be under the Protection of a Chriſtian Sovereign, <hi>as repreſenting a certain Perſon in the Commonwealth, and therefore to Act and Decree by plurality of Votes, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a Right, at leaſt by Conſent.</hi> For, there is a <hi>Medium</hi> betwixt the State or Commonwealth
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60718:94"/>
and a diſorderly Multitude, <hi>viz.</hi> a Colledge, where there is no occaſion for a coer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power. This may be illuſtrated by an Example: For, ſuppoſing in a Commonwealth a certain Society or Company of Merchants, regulated by certain Statures of their own, under the Direction of ſome of its own Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Into this Colledge a Prince has a mind to be received as a Member, paying his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhare. By being thus made a Member of this Company, he has not obtained an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute diſpoſal over this Society; but rather has accommodated himſelf to the Statutes of the Colledge, neither can he claim any other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative there, but what is derived either from his ſhare in that Company, or from a free Gift, and voluntary conſent of the reſt of its Members; and as a Member of this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he is to be conſidered, not as a Prince, but as a Merchant. There is nevertheleſs one remarkable difference, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is in the Power of a Sovereign to hinder the ſetting up of ſuch a Society, which is not the ſame in regard of the Church. He plainly betrays his Ignorance, when he ſays: <hi>That the Church is to be conſidered as a multitude of People, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the Perſon of one Prince; from whence the Prince repreſents the People, like one Publick Perſon, through whom the whole People declare their Sentiments.</hi> For, tho' this be appliable to the Commonwealth, it is not to the Church, they being quite different from one another. It cannot be denied, but that thoſe who have the Sovereign Power in the State, may Enact what Laws they think moſt convenient; But
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60718:94"/>
to attribute the ſame Power to Sovereigns over the Church, is a Madneſs, and ſavours of Blaſphemy. And, ſuppoſing a Prince ſhould be miſled into Errors, or Hereſie, muſt therefore the whole Church be accounted Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, or Heretical? Except he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us alſo, that Princes are Infallible. Wherefore in thoſe places where the Election of Miniſters is independent from the Prince, it is ſuppoſed to proceed from a Right tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred unto him by the Church; The ſame is to be underſtood, where this Election is man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged either by the Biſhops or Presbyters. But in caſe the ſame be done by the whole Church, it would be prepoſterous to ſay, that ſuch an Election was made by vertue of a Priviledge granted by the Prince. Mr. <hi>Houtuyn</hi> having granted before, <hi>That the Paſtoral Function, not being annexed to any certain Perſon, (conſidered as ſuch) had no dependency from the Civil Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, but owed its Inſtitution to Chriſt.</hi> Nevertheleſs in §. LXVI. he affirms: <hi>That the actual Adminiſtration of the Miniſterial Function is an External Publick Act, ſuch as is ſubject to the Civil Power.</hi> Which is the ſame in effect, as if he ſaid, Matrimony is a Divine Inſtitution, but it depends from the Prince, whether he will allow his Subjects to Marry actually or not. For, ſuppoſing a Sovereign ſhould take a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to forbid the antient Exerciſe of the Miniſterial Function, what would, in ſuch a Caſe, become of this Paſtoral or Miniſterial Function? It is alſo inſufferable what he ſays immediately after: <hi>An Election is a voluntary Act, therefore revocable at pleaſure;</hi> it being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60718:95"/>
that it cannot be done without impairing the Reputation of the Miniſter.</p>
            <p>What relates to §. LXVII. It is denied, that <hi>Nebuchadonoſor had any legal Authority</hi> to put to Death ſuch as refuſed to adore the great Statue, ſet up by his Order. For, a Prince who inflicts any Puniſhment upon his Subjects, againſt the expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the holy Scripture, does not, at that time exerciſe his legal Authority, but commits an hoſtile and tyrannical Act. So, when King <hi>Ahab,</hi> under pretence of a legal Proceſs, and by ſubborning of falſe Witneſſes, poſſeſs'd himſelf of <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard, did no more exerciſe his legal Juriſdiction, than a Guardian may be ſaid to do, when he commits a Rape upon a Pupil committed to his Management. But, when the ſame <hi>Nebuchadonoſor</hi> publiſhes his Edict, <hi>That no body dare to blaſpheme the God of the Jews,</hi> he did, without all queſtion, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what belong'd to his high Station. He runs on further; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Peter, John, Stephen, Paul,</hi> nay, even our Saviour himſelf, did appear before the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> before <hi>Foelix, Festus, Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> without taking the leaſt Exception againſt the legality of their Juriſdiction. What could be more falſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented? Did <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> acknowledge the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> in reſpect of the Chriſtian Doctrine, when they told them to their very Faces, that they would not obey their Command, of not preaching in the Name of Jeſus? Did <hi>Stephen</hi> acknowledge the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction <note place="margin">Act. 4. 19, 20.</note> of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> when he told them, You uncircumciſed in your Hearts and Ears,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60718:95"/>
you always reſiſt the holy Ghoſt? Neither is it an Argument, that <hi>Paul,</hi> and an infinite Number of Martyrs did acknowledge the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of thoſe Princes, and other Civil Magiſtrates, when they, being forced to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before them, endeavoured to prove their Innocence, there being no other Tribunal to which they could appeal; and it being at that time look'd upon as a Crime deſerving Death, for any one to profeſs himſelf a Chriſtian. All the defence they made may be reduced under two Heads: For they either denied thoſe Crimes laid to their Charge, as calumnious, or elſe they aſſerted even to the laſt, That the profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion did not depend from the Civil Juriſdiction. And thoſe Magiſtrates that abſolved the Confeſſors of this Truth, did in effect give this Sentence: <hi>That this was a Cauſe not belonging to their Juriſdiction.</hi> It is a wonder to me how Mr. <hi>Houtuyn,</hi> who pretends to be a Lawyer, can find out any thing in the leaſt reſembling a legal Proceſs in that Action of <hi>Pilate,</hi> it being to be conſidered no otherwiſe than a publick Robbery, and <hi>a power</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 53.</note> 
               <hi>of darkneſs,</hi> ſince in all his Proceedings, there is not a footſtep of a legal Proceſs to be met with. And it is ſo manifeſt, that, when reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Matters were in queſtion, the due Method and judicial Order of a legal Proceſs have been violated a thouſand times over and over, that it would be ſuperfluous to alledge any Examples of it here. When Sovereigns puniſh or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe a Paſtor or Miniſter of the Church, who has abuſed his Function, or been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in it, this power does properly
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60718:96"/>
not proceed from the Civil Juriſdiction, but from a Right tranſlated to the Sovereign by the Church. But thoſe that are puniſhed by the Civil Authority, becauſe <hi>they have ſtirr'd up, by their turbulent Speeches and Sermons, the People to Rebellion againſt their Soverereigns, or have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to withdraw the Auditors from, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Power of a legal Juriſdiction,</hi> cannot be ſaid to undergo Puniſhment on the account of the Chriſtian Religion. Furthermore, it is falſe, that the Church (conſidered as ſuch) can claim any Juriſdiction, properly ſpeaking. It is no leſs falſe, that the Power of diſpoſing and exerciſing thoſe Functions, belonging to each Church, is a civil Act, in regard of its publick Effect. Mr. <hi>Houtuyn</hi> has been drawn into all theſe Errors, by confounding the Commonwealth with the Church. If theſe two be not very nicely diſtinguiſhed, but we allow the Church to be entirely ſwallowed up in the civil Power, what have we got by ſhaking of the Popiſh Yoak? For, the condition of the Church will be never the better, if all Eccleſiaſtical Matters, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Exception are left to the arbitrary Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of Sovereigns; To maintain which, Mr. <hi>Houtuyn,</hi> in contradiction to all Reaſon and the Scripture it ſelf, has invented; <hi>A ſpiritual Good, or the eternal Welfare of People, as the main End and Duty of the Sovereign Power;</hi> By Vertue of which, he enables his Prince to force his Subjects to profeſs publickly what Religion he will be pleaſed to impoſe upon them, tho' never ſo contrary to their own Opinion. For it may be ſufferable for a Man to keep his own Opinion concealed to himſelf, but to be oblig'd
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60718:96"/>
to profeſs what is quite contrary to it, is both abominable and intolerable. The Saying of <hi>Constantine the Great,</hi> ſo much extoll'd by Mr. <hi>Houtuyn</hi> himſelf, is contradictory to his Aſſertion, <hi>viz. That he could have wiſh'd, all his Subjects to have been Chriſtians, but that he never forced any.</hi> For, this Emperour not only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attempted to force any one from his own Opinion (which indeed was beyond his Power) but alſo never conſtrained his Subjects to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs themſelves Chriſtians againſt their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. Our Author does alſo not a little contradict himſelf, in what he ſays concerning Words, ſometimes exempting them from any civil Cogniſance; whereas, before he had made them liable to the civil Juriſdiction: <hi>What,</hi> ſays he; <hi>if our Faith expreſs'd by Words ſhould come to the knowledge of our Sovereign? It ought to be look'd upon not ſo much as a Crime, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as an Error, to correct which, is not to be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Puniſhments (which do illuminate our Mind) but rather by good Inſtructions.</hi> But thoſe that know the real difference betwixt the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth and Church, that is to ſay, betwixt the State and a Colledge, may without much difficulty diſſolve theſe knotty Queſtions, which he has ſtarted concerining the Juriſdiction and Legiſlative Power of Princes over the Church.</p>
            <p>As to the §. LXIX. It is to be obſerved, that it is put beyond all queſtion, that Sovereigns have a Right to give the Authority and Force of a Law to ſuch Statutes as they find ſuitable to the State, it being their Prerogative to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, according to what Laws Judgment is to be given in Civil Courts of Judicature, what
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60718:97"/>
is puniſhable, and what is to be left to the Conſcience of every Subject. But it implies an Abſurdity, to attribute to Sovereigns a Right of giving publick Authority to Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies themſelves, neither the Intrinſick nor Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Faith having any dependence on the Civil Juriſdiction, by the force of which Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may be obliged to act, but not to believe. From whence it is evident, that if any Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy appear to be from God, it cannot receive any Addition by the Authority of the Prince, no more than if he ſhould declare <hi>Cicero</hi> to be a good <hi>Latin</hi> Author. But in caſe a pretended Prophecy be either ambiguous or ſuppoſititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in it ſelf, and a Prince ſhould perſuade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be able by his own Authority to make it paſs current for Truth, he would be look'd upon as one beyond his Senſes; What he inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates concerning the New Teſtament in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, is much of the ſame Stamp: <hi>It was not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in the power of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, to eſtabliſh this Doctrine</hi> (of the New Teſtament) <hi>by Publick Authority, which was the reaſon it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd in a private condition, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ill ſuch time when Princes having received the Chriſtian Faith, they gave it a publick Authority, and the force of Laws.</hi> But the Rules and Doctrine of Chriſt cannot receive any additional Strength from the Civil Power, it being contrary to its Genius to be eſtabliſhed and promoted by civil Puniſhments; For, whoſoever out of fear of Temporal Puniſhments, profeſſes in outward ſhew only this Doctrine, does not act according to, nor fulfil the Will of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:60718:97"/>
The ſame may be repliy'd to §. LXX. For, as the Scripture and the Chriſtian Doctrine do not owe their Authority to the civil Juriſdict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, the latter being introduced in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by God's peculiar Aſſiſtance, inſpite of all the Reſiſtance of the civil Powers; So ought the Interpretation of the the ambiguous and controverted Paſſages in the holy Scripture, not to be determined by the Sovereign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; it belonging not to the Prince only, but to the whole Church, or ſuch as are authoriſed by the Church; tho' at the ſame time, the Prince, conſidered as the Chief Member of it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>xcluded from having his ſhare in ſuch a Debate. It is a prophane Expreſſion when he ſays: <hi>Chriſt himſelf having an unqueſtionable Power of introducing a new Law, muſt needs have a right to interpret the ſame. But, ſince during the time of his abode here, he lived among thoſe, that either out of Ignorance or Diſobedience did not own Chriſt, and that in a private Condition, ſubject to the civil Power; it is evident, that his Laws, Doctrine, and the Interpretation of them, did acquire their obliging Power, and publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the civil Conſtitution.</hi> A little more would have made the Office of Chriſt, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mediator of the World, alſo dependent from the civil Juriſdiction. Is it not a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Abſurdity to affirm; <hi>That the Doctrine of Chriſt has received its publick Authority from the civil Power, among thoſe, who denied Chriſt? And what follows: That, if at the time of Chriſt, Princes had been Chriſtians, they would have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged him for the true God, and the Son of God, ſubmitting themſelves to his Judgment; ſo,</hi>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:60718:98"/>
               <hi>that the Interpretation of the Chriſtian Doctrine would have been owing by Chriſt, to their Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> Away with ſuch Fictions not agreeable even to common Senſe. He might as well ſay, that God's Power over us Mortals did owe its original to the ſubmiſſion of Princes; and in caſe they thought fit to withdraw themſelves from this Obedience, God Almighty (I cannot relate it without horror) muſt thereby be reduced to the Condition of a private Perſon.</p>
            <p>In the next Aſſertion, he is not altogether ſo much beyond his Senſes, when he grants, even to Pagan Princes, a Right of determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the controverted Points among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which is as much as to make a blind Man a competent Judge of the difference of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. When the Primitive Chriſtians were forced to appear before the Pagan Judges, it was not on the Account of the Interpretation of the Scripture; The Chriſtians could never be guilty of ſo groſs an Error, as to Conſult with the Unbelieving concerning the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Articles of Faith; But, being forced, againſt their will, to appear before them, they could not avoid to receive their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch as they were pleaſed to give, as having no way left them to decline it. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, our Author is pleaſed to affirm, That ſuch an Interpretation ought to be look'd upon as eſtabliſh'd by Publick Authority, which carries along with it an obliging force, at leaſt in outward appearance; ſo, that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are obliged to conform themſelves to it by a verbal Confeſſion, tho' never ſo diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60718:98"/>
from that Opinion, they keep concealed within their hearts. But, the outward Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and verbal Confeſſions of a Chriſtian, which are not agreeable to the true Sentiments of his Heart, having not the leaſt affinity with Religion it ſelf, I don't ſee, upon what Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count this Chimerical Power is attributed to Princes, unleſs it be, to furniſh them with a ſpecious pretext to afflict their Innocent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Thus much is certain, that Chriſt did not command his Doctrine to be propagated by forcible means; ſo, that, ſuppoſing the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, thus eſtabliſhed by the Civil Authority, to be never ſo conſonant to Truth, it is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs inconſiſtent with the Genius of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, to impoſe them upon Subjects by force, and under ſevere Penalties; But, ſuppoſing them to be falſe, the caſe of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects muſt needs be very miſerable, when they ſuffer Puniſhment, becauſe they will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs an erroneous or falſe Doctrine. I ſee no other benefit to be reap'd from the egregious Aſſertions of our Author, than to ſerve for a Juſtification of the moſt Tyrannical Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that have been, and to declare them to have been done by Vertue of a Legal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. At this rate it will be no difficult Task to juſtifie the Proceedings againſt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in <hi>France,</hi> which move both Pity and Horror in all good Men, at leaſt, Mr. <hi>Houtuyn</hi> has very freely offered his Advice and Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage. What follows next, is very ſmartly ſaid, to wit, <hi>That the Coerſive Power may be Legal, whereas the Act of Obedience is not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> No body of common ſenſe but will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60718:99"/>
that this implies a moſt manifeſt Contradiction, and, that the Legal Sovereign Authority, and the Obligation of paying O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to it, are inſeparable from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Yet with this Nicety Mr. <hi>Houtuyn</hi> is ſo mightily taken, that he does not conſider, that at the ſame time, he grants an abſolute Authority to his Prince, to perſecute his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects on the Account of Religion, he takes away from them the Power of denying the true Religion. But, what Reaſon can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, why the one ſhould have a coerſive Power, where the other cannot obey; unleſs it be done on purpoſe to encourage ambitious and imperious Princes, either to force their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to a ſinful compliance, or never to want an Opportunity of afflicting the Innocent at Pleaſure? For thoſe that take to theſe violent ways of propagating the Faith, or rather (to ſpeak Truth) Hypocriſie and Superſtition, by their booted Apoſtles, are not contented to ſilence their Subjects, diſſenting from them in Point of Religion, who are alſo debarr'd even to ſave themſelves by flight; (tho' it be no ſmall Misfortune to a Subject, to be forced to leave his Native Country) but they compel them to profeſs publickly thoſe things for Truth, which they abhor in their Hearts, and appear to be Idolatrous, Superſtitious, or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitious; invented on purpoſe by thoſe that make their Market by Religion. Mr. <hi>Houtuyn</hi> himſelf cannot but confeſs, <hi>That no body can ſafely acquieſce in any determination made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning an Article of Faith, unleſs by his own private Judgment he find it agreeable to the Word</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:60718:99"/>
               <hi>of God. And, if he find it not conſonant to that, he ought not to reſt ſatisfied in it, for fear he ſhould diſown his Faith, this being the worst, and most unbecoming thing belonging to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi> But, if it be unbecoming a Chriſtian to deny his Faith, which is the ſame in effect, <hi>as to rest ſatisfied in ones own private Opinion and Conſcience, to keep ſecret within the heart what one believes, not to indulge ones Tongue, and to refrain from External Actions.</hi> This being the Advice (which in contradiction to himſelf, he had not long before given to the Diſſenting Subjects) what Reaſon can he give for his Aſſertion, when he attributes to his Prince a Power ſo unlimited, that his Chriſtian Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects muſt either be forced to undergo ſuch an Indignity, or elſe the moſt horrible Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions that can be invented? The firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter of this unlimited Power, as far as ever I could learn, was Mr. <hi>Thomas H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bbs,</hi> the worſt Interpreter that ever was in Divinity; whoſe Opinion, as to this kind, no body has taken ſo much pains to revive with the ſame Impudence, as Mr. <hi>Adrian Houtuyn.</hi> What I moſt admire at, is, that this ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by one living in a State, whoſe Maxims are quite oppoſite to theſe Principles, and where conſequently he could not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably propoſe to himſelf any Reward of his Adulation; There being not the leaſt likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood that the States General of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> ſhould ever lay claim to ſuch a Power; As it is not very probable that Princes will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to the Miniſtry of the Church, and undertake the Publick Exerciſe of the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60718:100"/>
Paſtoral Function in Perſon; ſo, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee, to what purpoſe our Author has been ſo careful in aſſerting it, in the behalf of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns; Unleſs he has pleaſed himſelf with this Fancy, that his Aſſertions cannot fail to make him to be the more admired among the Youngſters, by how much the more remote they are from common Senſe. Thus much at preſent for Mr. <hi>Houtuyn.</hi>
