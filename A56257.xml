            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For, in the State of Natural Freedom, every one had a right to Sacrifice, though at the ≈øame time, every one was not obliged to Sacrifice for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf.

It ≈øeems to me, that there was a remarkable Difference betwixt the Excommunication of the Jews, by virtue of which they were excluded from their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and the Excommunication u≈øed among the Primitive Chri≈øtians. For, among the Jews, where the Sovereigns and the People profe≈ø≈øed one and the ≈øame Religion (which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60718:37"/>
al≈øo was entirely united with the State) it might ea≈øily happen, that the Exclu≈øion from the Synagogue, did carry along with it ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inconveniencies in Civil Affairs, and might therefore not unju≈øtly be con≈øidered at the ≈øame time, as a Civil Puni≈øhment; which, rendered the Offenders infamous in the Commonwealth; E≈øpecially, ≈øince, according to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Con≈øtitution of that Government, there were ≈øeveral things belonging to Religion pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhable by their civil Con≈øtitutions. But, it being already put beyond Que≈øtion, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Saviour, nor his Apo≈øtles, did ever pretend to any Civil Power; and that be≈øides this, the Primitive Chri≈øtians lived under the Juri≈ødiction of other Princes, how could their Excommunication, Ban, or what other ≈øort of Eccle≈øia≈øtical Cen≈øine was u≈øed among them, be ≈øuppo≈øed to have any influence upon the Civil State and Condition of the Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; or to have been of the ≈øame nature and force (properly ≈øpeaking) as Civil Puni≈øhments are? This will more plainly appear, if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine tho≈øe Pa≈ø≈øages, where this Matter is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly treated of in the New Te≈øtament: It is ≈øaid in <hi>Matthew</hi> 18. 15. 16, 17. <hi>If thy Brother ≈øhall tre≈øpa≈øs again≈øt thee, go, and tell him his Fault, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and him alone; If he ≈øhall hear thee, thou ha≈øt gained thy Brother.

His ≈øubjects are di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øed throughout all parts of the World, where the Chri≈øtian Doctrine is taught and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Believers, who, by the intrinlick, Vertue of this Doctrine, are confirmed in their Faith, and made proof again≈øt all the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations and Malice of this World. The Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Power does not reach this Kingdom; true Piety being not to be implanted by Human Force, which is in≈øufficient to procure God's Grace, or rai≈øe tho≈øe inward Motions which are chiefly acceptable to God Almighty; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, all our exterior Actions, that may be enforced by a Civil Authority, are to be deem'd vain and fruitle≈øs. For, the Kingdom of Chri≈øt being a Kingdom of Truth, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no Civil Power or Force; For, Truth, by the help of the Chri≈øtian Doctrine, and with the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of God's Grace, does gently in≈øinuate it ≈øelf into the Hearts of Men, and the Rewards or Puni≈øhments, which tho≈øe are to receive, that either accept or de≈øpi≈øe this Doctrine, are re≈øerved for the Life to come.

For, granting ≈øuch <note place="margin">Whether it be nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary to ≈øet up a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Judge of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover≈øies in the Church?</note> an univer≈øal Judge of all Controver≈øies ari≈øing in the Church, he mu≈øt be ≈øuppo≈øed to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, (and that beyond all contradiction) as well in point of Matter of Fact, as to the lawfulne≈øs of the Ca≈øe; for it may ≈øo happen, that it be plain enough, whether a Doctrine be erroneous or not, when at the ≈øame time, it may be di≈øput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, whether the ≈øaid Error ought to be laid to a certain Man's Charge or not? For, if an Appeal be allowed from this Judge, after Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence pronounced, there will never be an end of the Proce≈øs. It is therefore ab≈øolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui≈øite, that this infallible Authority ≈øhould be ≈øo manife≈øtly proved, that it cannot rea≈øonably be called in que≈øtion. For, unle≈øs this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity be unque≈øtionable for the deci≈øion of this Controver≈øie, we mu≈øt run from this Judge to another, who mu≈øt al≈øo be ≈øuppo≈øed to be Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, and ≈øo in infinite; it being granted by all, without Exception, that no body ought to be a Judge in his own Ca≈øe. And, ≈øince this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of being Infallible, could not be granted by any body, but by God alone; (the whole Body of Chri≈øtians, being not inve≈øted with ≈øuch a Power) it mu≈øt plainly be proved out of the Scriptures, that this particular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative and Authority was granted to one certain Per≈øon, for him and his Succe≈ø≈øors to

So, that there is but one way now left, for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the true Knowledge of the Chri≈øtian Religion, both for the Teachers in the Church, and all Believers in general, which is, to ≈øtudy the Scriptures devoutly, and without Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion.

Be≈øides this, it mu≈øt be ≈øuppo≈øed, that this univer≈øal Judge (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be to be look'd upon as an u≈øele≈øs En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine) mu≈øt be inve≈øted with a Power to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his Decrees, and to oblige all Chri≈øtians to acquie≈øce in his Judgment; For, if it be ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed, that his Decrees have no other force, than as far as they influence People by the force of Truth, they would be either u≈øele≈øs, or el≈øe this Judge in vain pretends thereby to any further Prerogative, but what he has in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with other Chri≈øtians that apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves to the Study of the holy Scripture. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, this obliging Power mu≈øt either have been obtained by a peculiar Privilegde granted by God Almighty, or by a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent of the Chri≈øtians, or by an inherent Right to a Sovereignty over all the Chri≈øtian Churches. As for a priviledge granted by God, or the general con≈øent of the Chri≈øtian Churches, there is not the lea≈øt Proof of it, as far as ever I could find; And as to the pretended Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power, its legal Title ought to be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ≈øuch Documents as are ≈øuitable to ≈øo great a Preten≈øion.

It is al≈øo to be taken notice of, that if this Eccle≈øia≈øtical So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty be granted, there mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity be a double headed Sovereign Power in one State; it being evident, that Subjects would be obliged to acknowledge the Authority of this Eccle≈øia≈øtical Judge in point of Controver≈øie, as well, and in the ≈øame mea≈øure, as they do the Authority of their civil Governours in civil Actions. And, ≈øince this Eccle≈øia≈øtical Sovereignty has a different ≈øcope from that, for which Civil Societies were erected, it mu≈øt con≈øequently be of a quite different nature, and make up a particular Sovereignty. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if both the≈øe ≈øhould happen to be joined in one Per≈øon, he becomes thereby at once ma≈øter over our Lives and Con≈øciences: But, if this Eccle≈øia≈øtical Juri≈ødiction be lodged in another Per≈øon, he mu≈øt either at the ≈øame time be acknowledged to have a Power of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his Decrees, by his own Prerogative, or el≈øe to have only an Authority of giving Sentence, leaving the Execution of it to the civil Magi≈øtrates. If the fir≈øt of the≈øe two be ≈øuppo≈øed, it is evident, that a double headed Sovereignty mu≈øt carry along with it great Inconveniencies and Di≈øtractions; and if the latter, tho≈øe that exerci≈øe the Sovereignty in the State, mu≈øt be look'd upon as Executioners only to this holy Judge.

For, if any one ≈øhould pretend to introduce a new Article of Faith, without endeavouring to prove it out of the holy Scripture, he would be look'd upon as a mad Man, tho' he ≈øhould call to his aid all the Sophi≈øtications of the Philo≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.

betwixt them and the <hi>Prote≈øtants,</hi> are in vain, unle≈øs the latter can re≈øolve to ≈øubmit them≈øelves under the ≈øame Popi≈øh Yoak which they have ≈øhaken off ≈øo long ago. I cannot ≈øufficiently admire that gro≈øs way of Arguing, made u≈øe of by the Papi≈øhes, when they talk of nothing el≈øe but the Authority of their Church, telling us, that, if we would but once acknowledge the ≈øame, all the Differences and Que≈øtions concerning the chief Articles of Faith would fall a-cour≈øe, making them≈øelves both Party and Judge, and pretending to give Sentence in their own Ca≈øe according to their own Te≈øtimony.

Peace, that is to ≈øay, no body further appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who could contradict them or oppo≈øe their Arguments, <hi>James</hi> at la≈øt aro≈øe, declaring that the Vi≈øion of <hi>Peter</hi> did agree to the Words of the Prophets, and that therefore it was his Opinion that ≈øuch among the Centiles as did turn to Chri≈øt ought not to be troubled. But that they al≈øo in ≈øome mea≈øure might gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them≈øelves, and to induce them not to fly the Conver≈øation of ≈øuch of the Gentiles as received the Chri≈øtian Faith, it was thought ≈øit that the≈øe ≈øhould ab≈øtain from Pollution of Idols, from Fornication, from things ≈øtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, and from Blood, all which was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the <hi>Mo≈øaic</hi> Law, and partly di≈øagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Law of Nature; as Fornication, which neverthele≈øs was a common Vice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles; the re≈øt being things indifferent in them≈øelves, might ea≈øily be let alone, rather than give Offence to a Brother.

If the whole matter be duly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <note place="margin">Some Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervations concerning the natura and u≈øe of Councils.</note> it furni≈øhes us with ≈øeveral Ob≈øervations, which may not a little contribute towards the Explaining the Nature of Eccle≈øia≈øtical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. In the fir≈øt place, it is mo≈øt apparent, that the≈øe Councils are not ≈øuch Bodies who≈øe Authority is everla≈øting for the Government of the Church: But that they are extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Convocations or Conventions, compo≈øed out of ≈øome ≈øelected and mo≈øt eminent Men of the Church, who are called together for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing certain Controver≈øies ari≈øen in the Church. And, becau≈øe tho≈øe Councils were very frequent in the Church from its Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, this alone may ≈øerve as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing argument, that the Church never acknowledged one infallible Judge for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding of Controver≈øies. For, to what purpo≈øe were ≈øo many Heads ≈øet to work, if one ≈øingle Per≈øon was ≈øufficient and infallible in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øion of them? And (what is yet more) if the Decrees of the Councils had only their obliging Force from his Confirmation. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, tho≈øe that compo≈øe ≈øuch a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil are not to be con≈øidered as Members of an A≈ø≈øembly or Colledge, who by the Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Votes can ≈øo ab≈øolutely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Que≈øtion in hand, as to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory to all Chri≈øtians in general; Truth generally ≈øpeaking, not depending from the Plurality of Suffrages; much le≈øs, can they pretend to a legi≈ølative Power ve≈øted in them ≈øo as to impo≈øe what Laws or Canons they plea≈øe upon the Church. But, they may be con≈øidered no otherwi≈øe than Men deputed by
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60718:59"/>
the Churches for the examining the true Grounds of the Controver≈øies laid before them, and for ≈øearching for the Deci≈øion of them in the Holy Scripture; So that the≈øe Churches are not obliged to acquie≈øce in this Deci≈øion any further than they find it agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Word of God. For it may chance to fall out ≈øo that a Controver≈øie which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears at fir≈øt ≈øight very intricate and difficult, afterwards being well weighed and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons thereof duly examined on both ≈øides, is very plain and ea≈øy to be determined. But if any moral Decrees are made by a Council, the ≈øame are to be taken to have no obliging Power, but what proceeds either from a preceding Commi≈ø≈øion and Authority, or from the Approbation of the≈øe Churches; ≈øo that Chuncils have no coercive Power over the Church. I cannot but touch, by the by, upon this Head, <hi>viz.</hi> that this A≈ø≈øertion; <hi>The Council is above the Pope,</hi> is of ≈øuch a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as will ea≈øily gain credit with all that are guided by right Rea≈øon, or the Scriptures. For, who can be ≈øo ≈øtupid as not to be ≈øen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that a great many learned Men, who with joint labour apply them≈øelves to the ≈øearch after Truth, are to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgment of one ≈øingle Per≈øon, and that oftentimes of ≈øuch a one, who has but a very indifferent in≈øight into the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Divinity.

the <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> Church pretends to be a Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal State; but this A≈ø≈øertion of the Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Councils, favours mo≈øt of an Ari≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy. But this Riddle may be unfolded in a few Words: The <hi>French</hi> Clergy allows the Pope to be the Supream Head of the Church, as far as they find it ≈øuitable with their Intere≈øt. But whenever he attempts any thing again≈øt them, or the States Policy of that Kingdom, the old Song of the Liberty of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, and the antient Doctrine of the <hi>Sorbone</hi> is revived, which ≈øerves the <hi>French</hi> Clergy now and then for a Pretext, to per≈øuade the vulgar ≈øort of People, that the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church has not been polluted with tho≈øe gro≈øs and abominable Errours as are introduced in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> The next thing to be con≈øidered is, that it is mo≈øt evident, that if a Controver≈øie ari≈øes, which may be decided within the Body of one Church, there is no Occa≈øion for the Communicating in ≈øuch a Point with other Churches; And, that, in ca≈øe one Church alone is not ≈øtock'd ≈øufficiently with able Teachers for the compo≈øing of the Difference, and therefore mu≈øt call to its Aid tho≈øe of other Churches, it is ≈øuperfluous to call together a greater number than may be ≈øufficient for the accompli≈øhment of the Work. So did the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> refer the whole Controver≈øie to tho≈øe of <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> without giving the lea≈øt Trouble to tho≈øe of <hi>Phenice</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> though their Deputies pa≈ø≈øed in their Way thither through both the≈øe Places. Be≈øides this, the Deputies that are ≈øent, ought to receive their Authority and In≈øtruction

from their ≈øeveral Churches, whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øent, becau≈øe no Church has without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve ≈øubmitted her≈øelf to the Determination of her Teachers, but only as far as their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is agreeable to the Word of God. Neither are the Words in the Epi≈øtle to the <hi>Hebr.</hi> c. 13. 17. to be under≈øtood any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe than with this Limitation. Be≈øides this, it is ab≈øolutely requi≈øite that ≈øuch Per≈øons as have rai≈øed a Controver≈øie ≈øhould be heard in the Council, that their Rea≈øons ≈øhould be duely examined, weighed, and proceeded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to the Rules pre≈øcribed in the Holy Writ. And if the Controver≈øie does not barely concern a Point of Doctrine, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a Temporal Intere≈øt, tho≈øe that have any Share in it cannot pretend to a Power of deciding the Point in Prejudice of the adver≈øe Party. From whence it is evident, that the Points in que≈øtion betwixt the Prote≈øtant Church and the Papal Chair cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed by any Council, their Difference ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing not barely from Point of Doctrine, but about Domination, Temporal Dignities, and va≈øt Revenues. Nor is there the lea≈øt Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of any Compo≈øition betwixt the≈øe two Parties by way of Arbitration; For who is it that can pretend to decide ≈øo great a Point? Who is likely to be accepted of as an Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor by both Parties? The Prote≈øtants, in all likelihood, will not be ≈øo fooli≈øh as to ≈øubmit them≈øelves and their Ca≈øe to the Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any A≈ø≈øembly con≈øi≈øting all of <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks their ≈øworn Enemies; nor can they have the Imprudence as to ask it.

the Pope, he likes his Station too well, to put it to the Hazard of an Arbitration.

Tho' an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Rea≈øon may be given, why the Apo≈øtles were not obliged to ask leave from the Civil Magi≈øtrates for the Con≈øtituting of Chri≈øtian Churches; becau≈øe the Apo≈øtles had received their immediate Authority of Preaching the Go≈øpel from him, who is the <hi>King of kings,</hi> and by who≈øe Command all Mankind were then call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to repentance. From what has been ≈øaid, this rational Conclu≈øion may be drawn; That the Apo≈øtles had not only a Power to plant Churches in all places, where they found their Auditors inclined to receive the Doctrine of the Go≈øpel, but that, al≈øo in all other places, whither this Doctrine was tran≈øplanted, the Believers might enter into ≈øuch a Society, or plant a Church upon their own accord, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Commi≈ø≈øion or Permi≈ø≈øion for ≈øo doing, from the Apo≈øtles; but, that, pur≈øuant to our Saviour's Expre≈ø≈øion, it was ≈øufficient, if two or three were inclined to meet in his Name. If we trace the true nature of the≈øe Societies,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60718:62"/>
which are con≈øtituted by a free Choice and Con≈øent of certain Men. we may ea≈øily find to contain, all of them, ≈øomething re≈øembling a Democracy, where ≈øuch Matters as concern the whole Body of the Society are to be di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched by common Con≈øent, and where no particular Per≈øon can claim any further Power over the re≈øt, than what he has received by their joint Con≈øent. From whence it may be rationally concluded, that at the fir≈øt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the Power of Con≈øtituting Teachers, and other Mini≈øters of the Church, was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally lodged in the whole Church, or, the whole Congregation of the Believers. And, tho' it is unque≈øtionable, that in the fir≈øt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, Teachers were con≈øtituted by the Apo≈øtles in a great many places; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs the <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">

It would be a hard Task to prove, that the Apo≈øtles did con≈øtitute Teachers them≈øelves in all le≈ø≈øer Towns, or that they preached the Go≈øpel in all le≈ø≈øer Places and Villages. It ≈øeems rather probable, that the Go≈øpel was publi≈øhed by the Apo≈øtles in great Cities, and other places of note; from whence it was communicated unto other Places; and, that ≈øuch Churches, as were not provided with Teachers, Bi≈øhops, or Presbyters by the Apo≈øtles them≈øelves, or their ≈øpecial Authority, u≈øed either to chu≈øe tho≈øe very Per≈øons to that Function, who were the fir≈øt Preachers of the Go≈øpel among them,

or any others, whom they e≈øteemed to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, before others, with the Gift of Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. If we con≈øult the Epi≈øtle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> it ≈øeems that the Go≈øpel had been taught at <hi>Rome,</hi> before ever <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> came thither; And the High Trea≈øurer of the <note place="margin">Chap. 16.</note> Queen <hi>Candaces,</hi> who is generally believed to have fir≈øt carried the Doctrine of the Go≈øpel to <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and to have been the fir≈øt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Chri≈øtian Churches in tho≈øe Parts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no Ordination as a Bi≈øhop or Presbyter from <hi>Philip,</hi> after his Bapti≈øm. Neither did <note place="margin">Acts 8.</note> Chri≈øt or his Apo≈øtles pre≈øcribe any certain Form, to be u≈øed in the Ordination of Bi≈øhops, as he did in the u≈øe of the Sacraments; which ≈øeems to prove that for the obtaining of this Function, there is nothing more required, than for the Per≈øon to be called by the Church, and to have the Gift of Teaching. It is not to be denied, but that the Ordination of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters, and Impo≈øition of Hands by the Bi≈øhops and Presbyters is a very laudable and u≈øeful Ceremony, and ought to be received as ≈øuch, with this re≈øtriction neverthele≈øs, that the ≈øame need not to be deemed ≈øo ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary, as if without it no Per≈øon ought to be taken for a true Mini≈øter of the Church; e≈øpecially ≈øince the≈øe miraculous Gifts which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that Ceremony in the Infancy of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church are many Ages pa≈øt, become u≈øele≈øs. The Church, like all other Colledges, <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4<hi>:</hi> 14.</note> have power to collect Stipends for their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters, and to make Collections for the U≈øe of the Poor; but in a different degree from that which belongs to Civil Magi≈øtrates or Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns,

How can a Prince be e≈øteemed to follow the Foot-≈øteps of Chri≈øt, who makes ≈øuch profligate Wretches as the Dragoons his Apo≈øtles, for the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of his Subjects?

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60718:75"/>
the Method of propagating the Chri≈øtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, according to the true Genius of the Chri≈øtian Religion. Be≈øides this, it is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary to maintain the Publick Tranquility, that all the Subjects in general ≈øhould be of one Religion, or, which is the ≈øame in effect, the differences about ≈øome Points in Religion, con≈øidered barely as ≈øuch, are not the true cau≈øes of Di≈øturbances in a State; but the Heats and Animo≈øities, Ambition and perverted Zeal of ≈øome, who make the≈øe Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences their Tools, wherewith they often rai≈øe Di≈øturbances in the State. Such turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Spirits ought to be curbed, and care to be taken ≈øo to tye up their Hands, as that they want Power to influence the Minds of ≈øuch Subjects, as otherwi≈øe would be well ≈øatisfied, to enjoy peaceably a Liberty of Con≈øcience. And what ≈øhould move a Prince to di≈øturb his good Subjects meerly upon the ≈øcore of Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in Opinion, as long as they live quietly under his Goverment? For, ≈øuppo≈øing their Opinion to be erroneous, it is not at his, but their own Peril, and they alone mu≈øt be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwerable for it.

If every thing be found con≈øonant to its Rules, then may a Sovereign by his Authority Command this Doctrine to be Taught both in publick and private.

Sovereign's care, that one may be compo≈øed by the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of ≈øuch as are well ver≈øed in the Holy Scripture, which being approved of by the general con≈øent of his Subjects, ought to be profe≈ø≈øed by all, and all tho≈øe e≈øpecially, who pretend to the Mini≈øtry, are to be tyed up to its Rules. This form of Wor≈øhip being once received,, a Prince may ju≈øtly deny his Peotection to all ≈øuch as will not comply with it, unle≈øs he find it to be again≈øt the Common Intere≈øt of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal.

For, ≈øince, according to the Doctrine of the Apo≈øtles, we are to avoid the Conver≈øation of Hereticks, it would be unrea≈øonable that a whole Society of Men ≈øhould fly from one or a few capricious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons; So that he or they ought to ≈øeek out for a new Habitation, after they have been legally convicted of their Error; for fear they ≈øhould ≈øpread their erroneous Doctrines further than may be con≈øi≈øtent with the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Safety.

as are of a different Opinion from the E≈øtabli≈øhed Religion.

For the Doctrine of the Go≈øpel is not de≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to civil Society, neither is thereby the lea≈øt Obligation laid upon Princes, to propagate Religion by violent and de≈øtructive means, or to undertake more in that behalf, than belongs to them as Protectors of the publick Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; they may therefore with a ≈øafe Con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ≈øupercede ≈øuch violent ways, by which the State either is endangered or weakned; e≈øpecially, ≈øince neither our Saviour did make u≈øe of them him≈øelf, nor commanded any thing like it to his Apo≈øtles. On the other hand, tho≈øe that expect to be tolerated in a State, ought by all means to endeavour to live peaceably and quietly, and as becomes good Subjects, they ought not to Teach any Doctrine which ≈øavours of Sedition and Di≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, or to ≈øuffer ≈øuch Principles to be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in their Congregations, as may prove de≈øtructive to the Prerogatives of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns.

For, there is not the lea≈øt que≈øtion to be made, but Princes have a right to rout out ≈øuch as propagate the≈øe Doctrines, they having not the lea≈øt relation to Religion, but are like ≈øpots, wherewith ≈øome turbulen Heads be≈øpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Chri≈øtian Religion. Be≈øides this, there is another duty incumbent to Sovereigns over a State, where more than one Religion is tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; <hi>viz.</hi> to keep a watchful eye over them, that the Di≈ø≈øenting Parties do not break out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to extravagant Expre≈ø≈øions about the Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Religion, the≈øe being the Fuel that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames them into Animo≈øities, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prove the ≈øpring of Factions, Troubles, and inte≈øtine Commotions. A much greater Obligation lies upon Sovereigns to tolerate Di≈ø≈øenters, if they, when they fir≈øt ≈øubmitted to the Government, had their Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience granted them by Contract; or have obtain'd it afterwards by certain Capitulations, any following Statutes, or by the fundmental Laws of the Land; all which ought to be ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred to Princes, and to be ob≈øerved by them with the ≈øame Circum≈øpection, as they expect a due Obedience from their Subjects. No O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion concerning matter of Religion ought to be declared Erroneous, before it be duely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, and the Parties convicted, e≈øpecially if they are ready to prove the ≈øame out of the Fundamental Articles of the Chri≈øtian Faith; And great care is to be taken that ≈øuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øion be not left to the Management of their Adver≈øaries, who being perhaps guided by ≈øelf Intere≈øt, oftentimes are both Accu≈øers and Judges.

A Prince ought not only to be ≈øatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, or rely entirely on what is repre≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him by his Clergy, (tho' never ≈øo pious in outward appearance;) there being too many In≈øtances to be given, that the be≈øt of Princes, by their own Inclinations, abhorring all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Cruelty, have, by the In≈øtigation of over-zealous Clergy-Men, turn'd the mo≈øt cruel Tyrants: We ≈øcarce ever read of any Prince, who undertook to decide Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øies in Phy≈øick, or other Sciences (except he had attained to a particular Knowledge in the≈øe Matters) and, why ≈øhould Sovereigns be too forward in deciding Religious Differences, which are of much greater Moment, (the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and temporal welfare of Millions of People do depend thereon) unle≈øs they be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well in≈øtructed in every thing that has any relation to it? And, ≈øince Princes very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be≈øtow ≈øufficient Time and Pains in being fully in≈øtructed in Divinity, it is to be wi≈øhed, that they would be bya≈ø≈øed by their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Under≈øtanding, rather than be influenc'd by the Opinions of others. As for an In≈øtance, in tho≈øe Controver≈øies which are betwixt the <hi>Prote≈øtants</hi> and <hi>Papi≈øts,</hi> there are ≈øuch evident Signs, from whence it is a difficult matter for a Chri≈øtian Prince to di≈øcern, which of the≈øe two ought to be preferred before the other.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60718:78"/>
For, if it be con≈øidered, that the <hi>Prote≈øtants</hi> are ≈øo far from forbidding the reading of the holy Scripture to the Laity, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they exhort them to it, and make the Scriptures the Touch≈øtone of their Doctrine, and the true Judge of their Controver≈øies; That the <hi>Prote≈øtants,</hi> tru≈øting upon the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of their own Cau≈øe, do not forbid the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Popi≈øh</hi> Authors, but allow them to be publickly ≈øold, as being confident, that the weakne≈øs of their Arguments cannot have any influence, even over an indifferent Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding; it cannot but ≈øeem very ≈øtrange, why in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Laity is not allowed the reading of the holy Scripture, nay, that they leave no ≈øtone unturn'd, to ≈øuppre≈øs the Validity of the holy Scripture; ≈øo, that in tho≈øe places where the Inqui≈øition is in vogue, a Man may with le≈øs danger be guilty of Bla≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, Perjury, and other the mo≈øt enormous Crimes, than to read and examine the My≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the holy Scripture. On the other hand, what a clamour do they make about Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Prerogatives of the Church, which Title they claim as belonging, in a mo≈øt peculiar manner to them≈øelves, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding the ≈øame is not allowed them by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they a≈ø≈øume to them≈øelves the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of giving Judgment in their own Cau≈øe. It is very well worth the Con≈øideration of a Prince, that they will not allow our Books to be read among them, and e≈øpecially, how careful they are in keeping them from the Knowledge of Great Men, tho' belonging to the Communion of their Church.

Sovereigns, neither have they any where el≈øe to ≈øeek for Protection. On the contrary, in what Pomp and affluence of Fortune does the <hi>Popi≈øh</hi> Clergy live! Unto what hight have they not exalted their Power in <hi>Europe!</hi> Have they not ≈øo ordered their Matters, as to be almo≈øt independant from the Civil Magi≈øtrates? What likelihood can there be in all this, that the <hi>Prote≈øtants</hi> ≈øhould be as much concerned for a Temporal By-Intere≈øt as the <hi>Popi≈øh</hi> Clergy? For, whereas, they fir≈øt can expect no more than what is alloted them already, the latter have no le≈øs in view than va≈øt Riches, and the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions of whole Kingdoms. All the≈øe Matters duely con≈øidered, may be convincing Proofs, that all the Clamour which the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øh</hi> Clergy makes again≈øt the <hi>Prote≈øtants,</hi> is of the ≈øame nature with that of <hi>Demetrius</hi> at <hi>Ephe≈øus,</hi> when he exclaimed again≈øt St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Love and Meekne≈øs being the products of the Chri≈øtian Faith; the Cruelties of the <hi>Popi≈øh</hi> Clergy exerci≈øed again≈øt <hi>Prote≈øtants,</hi> ought to be ≈øu≈øpected by Princes, and ≈øerve them as a forewarning; what good is to be expected from tho≈øe that pro≈øecute with ≈øo much Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity all ≈øuch, as oppo≈øe their Pride and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition?

For whenever the Civil Power bears any diminution under a Religious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, it is then high time for Sovereigns to look about them, to examine upon what Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation the≈øe Preten≈øions are built; it being evident, that Civil Goverment was introduced before the Chri≈øtian Religion, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought plainly to be demon≈øtrated, how Civil Authority came to be dimini≈øhed by the Chri≈øtian Religion. Now, if we look into the Con≈øtitution of the Popi≈øh Clergy, it is manife≈øt, that by many ≈øteps and degrees, and by various Artifices and Intrigues, they have at la≈øt patch'd up a Potent State of their

own; and that their Supream Head, for the≈øe many Ages pa≈øt, is po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd of great Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Acts as a Sovereign; and, not only this, but al≈øo obtrudes his Authority upon all ≈øuch as profe≈øs the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion. For, they don't think it ≈øufficient that the whole Clergy have their dependance from him, but he pretends to an Ab≈øolute Authority of determining all Matters of Faith, by which means he is ≈øure to guide the Minds of the People where ever he plea≈øes. If any thing in the World is de≈øtructive to the Civil Powers, it mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity be this, when a Party in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting their Territories, di≈øown their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈ødiction and depending from a Foreign Power; deny the Authority of their Natural Prince over them, or at lea≈øt acknowledge it no longer than they think it convenient. If Neighbouring States are commonly the mo≈øt jealous of one another, mu≈øt it not be look'd upon as a great Soloci≈øm of State, to permit ≈øuch as depend from a Foreign Juri≈ødiction to abide in the Commonwealth? It is next door to take Foreign Gari≈øons into our Forts, or to allow a Foreign Force to Encamp in the mid≈øt of our Dominions.

I cannot ≈øee how Princes, without great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Commonweal, can allow the lea≈øt Authority over their Per≈øons, to the Clergy; For, if the Prince and they happen to jarr together, the poor Subjects pay for it with a Vengeance, when they are to ≈øerve two Ma≈øters of a contrary ≈øide at one time; and the Taxes mu≈øt fall the heavier upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, where the Clergy are exempted from all Contributions.

The former being generally the mo≈øt ≈øevere; as is mo≈øt evident in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> where the Courts of Inqui≈øition are in vogue.

It is undeniable, that Subjects may ≈øeparate them≈øelves from the Communion of that Church, which is pro≈øe≈ø≈øed by their Sovereign and Clergy, provided they can make it evidently appear, that ≈øuch a Church is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with gro≈øs Abu≈øes, and dangerous Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.

For, civil Society was not in≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60718:85"/>
for Religion's ≈øake; neither does the Church of Chri≈øt participate of the nature of a Temporal State; and therefore a Prince that embraces the Chri≈øtian Faith, does not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by acquire an ab≈øolute Sovereignty over the Church or Mens Con≈øciences. So, that, if, notwith≈øtanding this Separation, the Subjects pay due Allegiance to their Prince in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Affairs, there is no rea≈øon ≈øufficient which can oblige him to trouble them meerly upon the ≈øcore of their Con≈øciences.

And granted the Power of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns in the Church to be much greater, than in effect it is, Subjects are neverthele≈øs bound to take care of their Souls, who≈øe Salvation is to be preferr'd before all other things, in regard of which they may ≈øeparate them≈øelves from an E≈øtabli≈øhed Religion, provided they are convinced of its Errors. For, that Subject who ≈øacrifices his Life for his Prince, does doubtle≈øs a glorious Action; but what Prince

can be ≈øo unrea≈øonable, as to expect that his Subjects ≈øhould Sacrifice their Souls to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil for his ≈øake. That Prince therefore who does trouble his faithful Subjects for no other rea≈øon, but becau≈øe they cannot conform to his Opinion (e≈øpecially if they can maintain theirs out of the Holy Scripture) commits an Act of Inju≈øtice; Nay, I cannot ≈øee how he can with Ju≈øtice force them out of his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories. It is true, he may refu≈øe to receive Hereticks into his Dominions, unle≈øs it be for Rea≈øons of State; Neither can a true Believer take it ami≈øs, if he is not permitted to ≈øettle in a Commonwealth govern'd by Hereticks. For, the Right of Naturalization belongs to Sovereigns, which they may refu≈øe and give to whom they think it convenient. But, as it is certainly the greate≈øt Inju≈øtice in the World, to force an in-born Natural Subject, who has ≈øettled all his Fortunes in a Commonwealth, meerly for his Religion's ≈øake, without being convicted of his Error, out of his Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to the great detriment and danger of him≈øelf and his Family. So, if a Subject in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines voluntarily to leave his Native Country, either to avoid the Frowns of his Prince, or the hatred of the Clergy and Common People, and to ≈øerve God with more freedom accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own Con≈øcience, it ought not to be refu≈øed by his Sovereign. I remember there is a certain Proverb u≈øed among the <hi>Germans,</hi> viz. <hi>He that Commands the Country, Commands Religion.</hi> But this cannot be applied to the Princes of the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Religion, who cannot lay any Claim to it, it being evident
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60718:86"/>
that the Popi≈øh Clergy do not allow any ≈øuch thing to the≈øe Princes; And, as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Prote≈øtant E≈øtates of <hi>Germany,</hi> it cannot be denied, but that they made u≈øe of this Preten≈øion again≈øt the Emperor at the time of the Reformation, which however ought to be thus interpreted; That they denied the Emperor to have any Power of intermedling in the Affairs relating to their own Dominions, not, that only they claim'd it as belonging to the Rights of Sovereignty to impo≈øe any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, tho' never ≈øo fal≈øe, upon their Subjects; notwith≈øtanding all which, there are not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Examples, that Princes have acted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to this Proverb with their Subjects. A Prince, who troubles his faithful Subjects meerly upon the ≈øcore of Religion, commits a gro≈øs Error; no Chri≈øtian Prince being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to propagate his Religion by forcible means; provided his Subjects ≈øtand firm to their Allegiance to him, he being not an≈øwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in particular for their Religion.

The Rea≈øon alledged is very frivolous: <hi>Becau≈øe all Publick and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Actions depend from the Publick Authority.</hi> Is this your A≈ø≈øertion, good Mr. <hi>Houtuyn,</hi> that Princes may impo≈øe what Religion they plea≈øe upon their Subjects, and by their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute Authority make it the e≈øtabli≈øh'd Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, with exclu≈øion to all others, who, if not complying, mu≈øt, for≈øooth, ≈øly the Country? What Religion they plea≈øe, do you ≈øay! the the Pagan, Fal≈øe, Fictious, or Super≈øtitious, it matters not which. From whence, pray, was this Power derived to Sovereigns? Not certainly from God, except you can ≈øhew us a Divine Authority for it. Not from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon con≈øent of tho≈øe that entred into Civil Societies; Commonwealths not being in≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for Religion's ≈øake, and of a later date; be≈øides, that ≈øuch a Power is not requi≈øite for the attaining that end, for which Civil Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were e≈øtabli≈øh'd. Neither is it left to the bare plea≈øure of any Per≈øon, tho' con≈øidered as in the Natural ≈øtate of Freedom, to profe≈øs what Religion he plea≈øes: But, ≈øuppo≈øing it was, no Inference can be made from thence, that the ≈øame may be forc'd upon others. The di≈øtinction he makes betwixt the <hi>internal and external Religion,</hi> mu≈øt al≈øo be taken with a great deal of Circum≈øpection, le≈øt ≈øome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might per≈øwade them≈øelves, that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different

what Religion a Man profe≈ø≈øes in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ≈øhew, provided he be ≈øatisfied as to the internal part of it. Furthermore, it is ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely fal≈øe, that all Publick Actions, that is, every thing done in Publick in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, owes its Original to the Sovereign Power; there being ≈øeveral things to be done by Subjects in publick, depending meerly from that Liberty belonging to them in the Natural ≈øtate of Liberty, or from God's Command, or from a certain Power granted to them by God Almighty.</p>
            <p>It is no le≈øs fal≈øe, That all exterior Actions depend from the Civil Authority; For, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. <hi>Houtuyn</hi>'s Opinion, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Divinity, and the Confe≈ø≈øion of Faith, as comprehended in a certain form, are to be reckoned among tho≈øe exterior Actions. Mr. <hi>Houtuyn</hi> is much in the wrong, when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to draw an Inference from thence; that, becau≈øe it belongs to Sovereigns to take care, that their Subjects may be well in≈øtructed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning what Opinion they ought to have of God, as the E≈øtabli≈øher of Ju≈øtice; they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have a Right of di≈øpo≈øing (in an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way) of revealed Religion, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare any Religion what≈øoever, which pretends to Revelation, the E≈øtabli≈øh'd Religion in the Commonwealth. It is a much gro≈ø≈øer Mi≈øtake yet, when he a≈ø≈øerts: That <hi>any Religion e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øh'd in a State, tho' never ≈øo fal≈øe, contributes to the Publick Tranquility of that Commonwealth.</hi> It is po≈ø≈øible that a Religion defective in ≈øome Points, may neverthele≈øs lead People into the way of Salvation; but tho≈øe that contain fal≈øe
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60718:90"/>
Doctrines of God and his Attributes, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of producing that Effect. The Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tranquility, founded upon ≈øuch fal≈øe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, will be very un≈øtable, and may with more ea≈øe, or at lea≈øt with the ≈øame conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency be obtained by the true Doctrine; e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be taken into con≈øideration, that, tho' it be po≈ø≈øible that ≈øuch Impo≈øtures may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile the giddy-headed Multitude, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not always pa≈øs for currant among Men of a ≈øound Under≈øtanding: It is to be remembred, that the South≈øayers at <hi>Rome</hi> cannot forbear laughing, when they meet another of the ≈øame Profe≈ø≈øion. We mu≈øt beg Mr. <hi>Houtuyn</hi>'s Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, if we que≈øtion his Authority, when he pretends to per≈øwade us: That <hi>Faith,</hi> which he is plea≈øed to call <hi>every ones private Religion, independent from any Temporal Power,</hi> will not be impaired by a Man's profe≈ø≈øing any other Religion, e≈øtabli≈øhed by the Sovereign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and he leaves it to the di≈øcretion of tho≈øe Civil Governours, which of all Religions they will be plea≈øed to e≈øtabli≈øh in their Dominions, whether that of the <hi>Japone≈øes,</hi> of the <hi>Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Mahometans, Jews,</hi> or <hi>Chri≈øtians;</hi> and among all tho≈øe that pretend to the Chri≈øtian Name, ≈øuch a one as may be mo≈øt agreeable to their own Fancy. I much que≈øtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will meet with many Tools, that will take his Word for it. A great part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtendom did look upon it as a thing in≈øuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> ≈øhould ≈øet up for the great Arbitrator of Chri≈øtendom in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters relating to the Chri≈øtian Faith, tho' his Pretences did not reach further than to force
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60718:91"/>
one Religion upon the World, which he knew was mo≈øt likely to turn to his own Advantage: But now it ≈øeems it has plea≈øed God, that Sovereigns ≈øhould be inve≈øted with a Power of e≈øtabli≈øhing any Religion at plea≈øure; and it being beyond que≈øtion, that there are ≈øeveral Religions which have not the lea≈øt relation to one another, they may, with the ≈øame Right, at ≈øeveral times, declare, ≈øeveral di≈øtinct Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, nay, even tho≈øe that are quite oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øite to one another, the e≈øtabli≈øh'd Religion, and neverthele≈øs every one of the≈øe mu≈øt be accepted, for≈øooth, as the true Religion. The next Con≈øequence will be, that Sovereigns, having a Right of defending and altering the e≈øtabli≈øh'd Religion, and to puni≈øh ≈øuch as tre≈øpa≈øs again≈øt it, one Prince will have no more Right to cheri≈øh and maintain one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but his Succe≈ø≈øors may, with the ≈øame Right, aboli≈øh it, and puni≈øh ≈øuch of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as adhere to it. So that according to the Doctrine of Mr. <hi>Houtuyn</hi>'s Go≈øpel, the e≈øtabli≈øh'd Religion will be ≈øettled upon the ≈øame Foundation with ≈øome Statutes, which may be enacted and repeal'd by Sovereigns at plea≈øure.</p>
            <p>In ¬ß. LXV. He entirely, and without limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, a≈øcribes to the Prince the Power of <hi>Con≈øtituting Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpel, in the ≈øame manner as if they were Mini≈øters of the State.</hi> But in the Commonwealth of the <hi>Jews,</hi> regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated according to God's own In≈øtitution, no ≈øuch Power was granted to their Kings; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had the Apo≈øtles them≈øelves, (tho' the mo≈øt general Teachers that ever were (as
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60718:91"/>
being ≈øent to Preach the Go≈øpel to all the World) their Authority of Teaching from any Temporal Sovereigns. Neither can it be proved, that the Church, at the time, when Sovereigns fir≈øt embraced the Chri≈øtian Faith, did transferr this Power of con≈øtituting Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters of the Go≈øpel, without limitation, to tho≈øe Princes; tho' at the ≈øame time it is not to be denied, but that Sovereigns have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderable ≈øhare in it. His Argument taken from <hi>the care Parents ought to have of the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Children,</hi> does not reach to what he pretends to prove; for, ≈øays he, Princes being the Publick Fathers of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; <hi>it belongs to their Princely Office, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the Eternal Salvation of their Subjects.</hi> For, be≈øides that, the Title of <hi>Father of the Commonwealth</hi> is a Metaphorical Expre≈ø≈øion, the Fatherly and the Regal Office depend from a quite different Principle, and the care to be taken of Children of a tender Age, is of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature with that which ought to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for the Safety of a whole People; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were Sovereigns inve≈øted with the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Authority to enable them to procure Eternal Salvation to their Subjects, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving pre≈øcribed other ways and means for the obtaining of it. It cannot be denied, but that a Prince mu≈øt not be regardle≈øs of this Care, neverthele≈øs ought the ≈øame not to reach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its due Bounds, but mu≈øt be effected by ≈øuch Methods as are approved of in the Holy Scripture, and ≈øuit with the true Genius of the Chri≈øtian Religion; Wherefore, it is in vain to attribute to Sovereigns a Power of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60718:92"/>
obtruding any Religion, at plea≈øure, upon their Subjects; it being beyond que≈øtion, that not all Religions are conducing to obtain Eternal Salvation. So <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, did not impo≈øe upon his Children what Religion he thought mo≈øt convenient, but he charged them to walk in the ways of the Lord, ≈øuch as were manife≈øted to them in the Holy Scripture. What St. <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øays, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. is very well worth taking notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> That the chief care of the Supream Governours ≈øhall be, ≈øo to Rule over their Subjects, that they may live under them, not only hone≈øtly, but piou≈øly; this being the way to Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is to be ob≈øerved, that tho≈øe Princes, for whom the Apo≈øtle enjoined the Chri≈øtians to pray, being Pagans, made but little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Piety, e≈øpecially of that belonging to the Chri≈øtians; but it was thought ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the Chri≈øtians to enjoy the common Benefit of the Publick Tranquility under their Protection, the re≈øt being left to their own care. So we read that the Poet's enjoyment of his Mu≈øes, was owing to <hi>Augu≈øtus Cae≈øar</hi>'s Protection; neverthele≈øs the Emperor did not concern him≈øelf about the Rules of Poetry. Furthermore, it is a very gro≈øs way of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when he A≈ø≈øerts: That, <hi>the Commonwealth and Church are both one and the ≈øame thing under a Chri≈øtian Prince, who≈øe Subjects al≈øo profe≈øs the Chri≈øtian Religion, the only difference being in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect of their different Qualifications: They being in the Commonwealth to be con≈øidered as they are Subjects, in the Church as Believers.</hi> It ≈øeems, Mr. <hi>Houtuyn</hi> looks upon that Difference to be
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60718:92"/>
of little moment, which ari≈øes from divers Moral Qualifications, and includes different Obligations, and is founded upon another Legal Principle. It is confe≈øs'd, that in ≈øuch a ca≈øe where the Head is not differing in his Natural Con≈øtitution from the Rights and Power belonging to him, the re≈øt of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, tho' differently con≈øidered under divers Qualifications, are neverthele≈øs to be look'd upon as one and the ≈øame Society. As for in≈øtance: If a Prince puts him≈øelf at the Head of all his Subjects upon an Expedition, the≈øe, tho' they may be con≈øidered either as Soldiers or Subjects, yet do not differ in any E≈ø≈øential Part; As for Example: The People of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> when going upon their Expedition under the Conduct of <hi>Jo≈øhua,</hi> was the very ≈øame that afterwards, under his Protection, enjoyed and inhabited the Country of <hi>Canaan.</hi> But the Church and Commonwealth, tho' compo≈øed out of the ≈øelf-≈øame Per≈øons, do not only differ in their very Foundation, but al≈øo a Sovereign cannot claim the ≈øame Right and Name of being the Supream Head of the Church in the ≈øame ≈øen≈øe, as he is the Supream Governour of the State. For, in the latter he exerci≈øes his Authority without controul, being ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to no body; But, the Head of the Church is Chri≈øt, who Rules it by his Word, announ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to us by the Teachers of the Church; ≈øo, that a Sovereign cannot as much as claim the Right of being Chri≈øt's Vicegerent in the Church; And, on the other hand, tho' it is ≈øaid of Chri≈øt, <hi>That all Power is given unto him in Heaven, and upon Earth,</hi> neverthele≈øs it
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60718:93"/>
cannot be ≈øaid of him, to be, in the ≈øame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Head of Civil Societies, as of the Church. The next following A≈ø≈øertion runs thus: <hi>Where the whole Commonwealth is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed out of Chri≈øtians, the Church is a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Believers in the Commonwealth.</hi> But, where all Subjects are Chri≈øtians, the Church is neverthele≈øs nothing el≈øe than a Colledge in the Commonwealth. But what he alledges of the Church being ≈øometimes taken in the ≈øame ≈øen≈øe with the Commonwealth, is ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely fal≈øe. For the words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> in <hi>Acts</hi> 14 23. and tho≈øe in <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> are no Synoms; but the latter is to be under≈øtood thus: In all the Towns and Cities, where there was any Chri≈øtian Church. The Inference he would make from the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Function, and the Admini≈øtration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice, being both included in one Government, is to no purpo≈øe; both of them owing their Off-≈øpring to that End for which Civil Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were in≈øtituted, which is not the ≈øame in the Church; and Sovereigns are entru≈øted with the Sword of War and Ju≈øtice, not with the Mini≈øterial Function of Preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpel. From whence it comes, that Generals and Judges are ≈øubordinate to the Princely Office, but not the Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpel, they being (barely con≈øidered as ≈øuch) not properly Mini≈øters of the Prince and State, but Mini≈øters of Chri≈øt and the Church. He ≈øays further; <hi>That the a≈ø≈øignation of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterial Function does not appertain to the Internal part of Religion.</hi> But if Faith comes from hearing, and no body can believe, without
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60718:93"/>
being in≈øtructed; it is undeniable, that tho≈øe that Preach the Go≈øpel, have a ≈øhare in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part of Religion, they being to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered as the In≈øtruments, by the help of whom, the Go≈øpel, and con≈øequently the Faith, is conveyed to their Auditors. It is fal≈øe, when he a≈ø≈øerts, That Sovereigns, tho' no Chri≈øtians, have a Right of con≈øtituting Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters; <hi>For,</hi> ≈øays he, <hi>their Right is the ≈øame.</hi> But a Prince, who makes not Profe≈ø≈øion of the Chri≈øtian Faith, tho' he has Chri≈øtian Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects under his Juri≈ødiction, and allows them the free Exerci≈øe of their Religion, has never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele≈øs not the lea≈øt Power over their Church, as being no Member of it. It is no le≈øs fal≈øe, what he ≈øays, that ≈øince Princes are become Chri≈øtians, the Vocation of Mini≈øters does no more depend from the Church; <hi>Ju≈øt as a Man, by ≈øubmitting him≈øelf under another Juri≈ødiction, is no more at his own di≈øpo≈øal.</hi> For, a Prince by becoming a Member of the Church, does there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not make him≈øelf Ma≈øter of that Church, but rather ≈øubmits to the Obedience of Chri≈øt, the Head of the Church; and therefore does not incroach all its Rights to him≈øelf, but only can claim his ≈øhare as ≈øuch, unle≈øs a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Church ≈øhould voluntarily ≈øurrender its Rights, as far as it lies in its power, to the Sovereign. And I ≈øee no rea≈øon, why the Church may not be under the Protection of a Chri≈øtian Sovereign, <hi>as repre≈øenting a certain Per≈øon in the Commonwealth, and therefore to Act and Decree by plurality of Votes, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a Right, at lea≈øt by Con≈øent.</hi> For, there is a <hi>Medium</hi> betwixt the State or Commonwealth
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60718:94"/>
and a di≈øorderly Multitude, <hi>viz.</hi> a Colledge, where there is no occa≈øion for a coer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power. This may be illu≈øtrated by an Example: For, ≈øuppo≈øing in a Commonwealth a certain Society or Company of Merchants, regulated by certain Statures of their own, under the Direction of ≈øome of its own Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Into this Colledge a Prince has a mind to be received as a Member, paying his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ≈øhare. By being thus made a Member of this Company, he has not obtained an ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute di≈øpo≈øal over this Society; but rather has accommodated him≈øelf to the Statutes of the Colledge, neither can he claim any other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative there, but what is derived either from his ≈øhare in that Company, or from a free Gift, and voluntary con≈øent of the re≈øt of its Members; and as a Member of this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he is to be con≈øidered, not as a Prince, but as a Merchant. There is neverthele≈øs one remarkable difference, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is in the Power of a Sovereign to hinder the ≈øetting up of ≈øuch a Society, which is not the ≈øame in regard of the Church. He plainly betrays his Ignorance, when he ≈øays: <hi>That the Church is to be con≈øidered as a multitude of People, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the Per≈øon of one Prince; from whence the Prince repre≈øents the People, like one Publick Per≈øon, through whom the whole People declare their Sentiments.</hi> For, tho' this be appliable to the Commonwealth, it is not to the Church, they being quite different from one another. It cannot be denied, but that tho≈øe who have the Sovereign Power in the State, may Enact what Laws they think mo≈øt convenient; But
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60718:94"/>
to attribute the ≈øame Power to Sovereigns over the Church, is a Madne≈øs, and ≈øavours of Bla≈øphemy. And, ≈øuppo≈øing a Prince ≈øhould be mi≈øled into Errors, or Here≈øie, mu≈øt therefore the whole Church be accounted Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, or Heretical? Except he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwade us al≈øo, that Princes are Infallible. Wherefore in tho≈øe places where the Election of Mini≈øters is independent from the Prince, it is ≈øuppo≈øed to proceed from a Right tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred unto him by the Church; The ≈øame is to be under≈øtood, where this Election is man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged either by the Bi≈øhops or Presbyters. But in ca≈øe the ≈øame be done by the whole Church, it would be prepo≈øterous to ≈øay, that ≈øuch an Election was made by vertue of a Priviledge granted by the Prince. Mr. <hi>Houtuyn</hi> having granted before, <hi>That the Pa≈øtoral Function, not being annexed to any certain Per≈øon, (con≈øidered as ≈øuch) had no dependency from the Civil Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈ødiction, but owed its In≈øtitution to Chri≈øt.</hi> Neverthele≈øs in ¬ß. LXVI. he affirms: <hi>That the actual Admini≈øtration of the Mini≈øterial Function is an External Publick Act, ≈øuch as is ≈øubject to the Civil Power.</hi> Which is the ≈øame in effect, as if he ≈øaid, Matrimony is a Divine In≈øtitution, but it depends from the Prince, whether he will allow his Subjects to Marry actually or not. For, ≈øuppo≈øing a Sovereign ≈øhould take a Re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to forbid the antient Exerci≈øe of the Mini≈øterial Function, what would, in ≈øuch a Ca≈øe, become of this Pa≈øtoral or Mini≈øterial Function? It is al≈øo in≈øufferable what he ≈øays immediately after: <hi>An Election is a voluntary Act, therefore revocable at plea≈øure;</hi> it being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60718:95"/>
that it cannot be done without impairing the Reputation of the Mini≈øter.</p>
            <p>What relates to ¬ß. LXVII. It is denied, that <hi>Nebuchadono≈øor had any legal Authority</hi> to put to Death ≈øuch as refu≈øed to adore the great Statue, ≈øet up by his Order. For, a Prince who inflicts any Puni≈øhment upon his Subjects, again≈øt the expre≈øs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the holy Scripture, does not, at that time exerci≈øe his legal Authority, but commits an ho≈øtile and tyrannical Act. So, when King <hi>Ahab,</hi> under pretence of a legal Proce≈øs, and by ≈øubborning of fal≈øe Witne≈ø≈øes, po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd him≈øelf of <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard, did no more exerci≈øe his legal Juri≈ødiction, than a Guardian may be ≈øaid to do, when he commits a Rape upon a Pupil committed to his Management. But, when the ≈øame <hi>Nebuchadono≈øor</hi> publi≈øhes his Edict, <hi>That no body dare to bla≈øpheme the God of the Jews,</hi> he did, without all que≈øtion, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what belong'd to his high Station. He runs on further; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Peter, John, Stephen, Paul,</hi> nay, even our Saviour him≈øelf, did appear before the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> before <hi>Foelix, Festus, Cae≈øar</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> without taking the lea≈øt Exception again≈øt the legality of their Juri≈ødiction. What could be more fal≈øely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented? Did <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> acknowledge the Juri≈ødiction of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> in re≈øpect of the Chri≈øtian Doctrine, when they told them to their very Faces, that they would not obey their Command, of not preaching in the Name of Je≈øus? Did <hi>Stephen</hi> acknowledge the Juri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction <note place="margin">Act. 4. 19, 20.</note> of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> when he told them, You uncircumci≈øed in your Hearts and Ears,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60718:95"/>
you always re≈øi≈øt the holy Gho≈øt? Neither is it an Argument, that <hi>Paul,</hi> and an infinite Number of Martyrs did acknowledge the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈ødiction of tho≈øe Princes, and other Civil Magi≈øtrates, when they, being forced to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before them, endeavoured to prove their Innocence, there being no other Tribunal to which they could appeal; and it being at that time look'd upon as a Crime de≈øerving Death, for any one to profe≈øs him≈øelf a Chri≈øtian. All the defence they made may be reduced under two Heads: For they either denied tho≈øe Crimes laid to their Charge, as calumnious, or el≈øe they a≈ø≈øerted even to the la≈øt, That the profe≈ø≈øion of the Chri≈øtian Religion did not depend from the Civil Juri≈ødiction. And tho≈øe Magi≈øtrates that ab≈øolved the Confe≈ø≈øors of this Truth, did in effect give this Sentence: <hi>That this was a Cau≈øe not belonging to their Juri≈ødiction.</hi> It is a wonder to me how Mr. <hi>Houtuyn,</hi> who pretends to be a Lawyer, can find out any thing in the lea≈øt re≈øembling a legal Proce≈øs in that Action of <hi>Pilate,</hi> it being to be con≈øidered no otherwi≈øe than a publick Robbery, and <hi>a power</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 53.</note> 
               <hi>of darkne≈øs,</hi> ≈øince in all his Proceedings, there is not a foot≈øtep of a legal Proce≈øs to be met with. And it is ≈øo manife≈øt, that, when reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Matters were in que≈øtion, the due Method and judicial Order of a legal Proce≈øs have been violated a thou≈øand times over and over, that it would be ≈øuperfluous to alledge any Examples of it here. When Sovereigns puni≈øh or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øti≈øe a Pa≈øtor or Mini≈øter of the Church, who has abu≈øed his Function, or been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in it, this power does properly
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60718:96"/>
not proceed from the Civil Juri≈ødiction, but from a Right tran≈ølated to the Sovereign by the Church. But tho≈øe that are puni≈øhed by the Civil Authority, becau≈øe <hi>they have ≈øtirr'd up, by their turbulent Speeches and Sermons, the People to Rebellion again≈øt their Soverereigns, or have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to withdraw the Auditors from, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt the Power of a legal Juri≈ødiction,</hi> cannot be ≈øaid to undergo Puni≈øhment on the account of the Chri≈øtian Religion. Furthermore, it is fal≈øe, that the Church (con≈øidered as ≈øuch) can claim any Juri≈ødiction, properly ≈øpeaking. It is no le≈øs fal≈øe, that the Power of di≈øpo≈øing and exerci≈øing tho≈øe Functions, belonging to each Church, is a civil Act, in regard of its publick Effect. Mr. <hi>Houtuyn</hi> has been drawn into all the≈øe Errors, by confounding the Commonwealth with the Church. If the≈øe two be not very nicely di≈øtingui≈øhed, but we allow the Church to be entirely ≈øwallowed up in the civil Power, what have we got by ≈øhaking of the Popi≈øh Yoak? For, the condition of the Church will be never the better, if all Eccle≈øia≈øtical Matters, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Exception are left to the arbitrary Di≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øal of Sovereigns; To maintain which, Mr. <hi>Houtuyn,</hi> in contradiction to all Rea≈øon and the Scripture it ≈øelf, has invented; <hi>A ≈øpiritual Good, or the eternal Welfare of People, as the main End and Duty of the Sovereign Power;</hi> By Vertue of which, he enables his Prince to force his Subjects to profe≈øs publickly what Religion he will be plea≈øed to impo≈øe upon them, tho' never ≈øo contrary to their own Opinion. For it may be ≈øufferable for a Man to keep his own Opinion concealed to him≈øelf, but to be oblig'd
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60718:96"/>
to profe≈øs what is quite contrary to it, is both abominable and intolerable. The Saying of <hi>Constantine the Great,</hi> ≈øo much extoll'd by Mr. <hi>Houtuyn</hi> him≈øelf, is contradictory to his A≈ø≈øertion, <hi>viz. That he could have wi≈øh'd, all his Subjects to have been Chri≈øtians, but that he never forced any.</hi> For, this Emperour not only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attempted to force any one from his own Opinion (which indeed was beyond his Power) but al≈øo never con≈øtrained his Subjects to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øs them≈øelves Chri≈øtians again≈øt their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. Our Author does al≈øo not a little contradict him≈øelf, in what he ≈øays concerning Words, ≈øometimes exempting them from any civil Cogni≈øance; whereas, before he had made them liable to the civil Juri≈ødiction: <hi>What,</hi> ≈øays he; <hi>if our Faith expre≈øs'd by Words ≈øhould come to the knowledge of our Sovereign? It ought to be look'd upon not ≈øo much as a Crime, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as an Error, to correct which, is not to be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Puni≈øhments (which do illuminate our Mind) but rather by good In≈øtructions.</hi> But tho≈øe that know the real difference betwixt the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth and Church, that is to ≈øay, betwixt the State and a Colledge, may without much difficulty di≈ø≈øolve the≈øe knotty Que≈øtions, which he has ≈øtarted concerining the Juri≈ødiction and Legi≈ølative Power of Princes over the Church.</p>
            <p>As to the ¬ß. LXIX. It is to be ob≈øerved, that it is put beyond all que≈øtion, that Sovereigns have a Right to give the Authority and Force of a Law to ≈øuch Statutes as they find ≈øuitable to the State, it being their Prerogative to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, according to what Laws Judgment is to be given in Civil Courts of Judicature, what
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60718:97"/>
is puni≈øhable, and what is to be left to the Con≈øcience of every Subject. But it implies an Ab≈øurdity, to attribute to Sovereigns a Right of giving publick Authority to Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øies them≈øelves, neither the Intrin≈øick nor Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtorical Faith having any dependence on the Civil Juri≈ødiction, by the force of which Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may be obliged to act, but not to believe. From whence it is evident, that if any Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy appear to be from God, it cannot receive any Addition by the Authority of the Prince, no more than if he ≈øhould declare <hi>Cicero</hi> to be a good <hi>Latin</hi> Author. But in ca≈øe a pretended Prophecy be either ambiguous or ≈øuppo≈øititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in it ≈øelf, and a Prince ≈øhould per≈øuade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf to be able by his own Authority to make it pa≈øs current for Truth, he would be look'd upon as one beyond his Sen≈øes; What he in≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates concerning the New Te≈øtament in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, is much of the ≈øame Stamp: <hi>It was not,</hi> ≈øays he, <hi>in the power of Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles, to e≈øtabli≈øh this Doctrine</hi> (of the New Te≈øtament) <hi>by Publick Authority, which was the rea≈øon it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd in a private condition, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ill ≈øuch time when Princes having received the Chri≈øtian Faith, they gave it a publick Authority, and the force of Laws.</hi> But the Rules and Doctrine of Chri≈øt cannot receive any additional Strength from the Civil Power, it being contrary to its Genius to be e≈øtabli≈øhed and promoted by civil Puni≈øhments; For, who≈øoever out of fear of Temporal Puni≈øhments, profe≈ø≈øes in outward ≈øhew only this Doctrine, does not act according to, nor fulfil the Will of Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:60718:97"/>
The ≈øame may be repliy'd to ¬ß. LXX. For, as the Scripture and the Chri≈øtian Doctrine do not owe their Authority to the civil Juri≈ødict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, the latter being introduced in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by God's peculiar A≈ø≈øi≈øtance, in≈øpite of all the Re≈øi≈øtance of the civil Powers; So ought the Interpretation of the the ambiguous and controverted Pa≈ø≈øages in the holy Scripture, not to be determined by the Sovereign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; it belonging not to the Prince only, but to the whole Church, or ≈øuch as are authori≈øed by the Church; tho' at the ≈øame time, the Prince, con≈øidered as the Chief Member of it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>xcluded from having his ≈øhare in ≈øuch a Debate. It is a prophane Expre≈ø≈øion when he ≈øays: <hi>Chri≈øt him≈øelf having an unque≈øtionable Power of introducing a new Law, mu≈øt needs have a right to interpret the ≈øame. But, ≈øince during the time of his abode here, he lived among tho≈øe, that either out of Ignorance or Di≈øobedience did not own Chri≈øt, and that in a private Condition, ≈øubject to the civil Power; it is evident, that his Laws, Doctrine, and the Interpretation of them, did acquire their obliging Power, and publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the civil Con≈øtitution.</hi> A little more would have made the Office of Chri≈øt, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mediator of the World, al≈øo dependent from the civil Juri≈ødiction. Is it not a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Ab≈øurdity to affirm; <hi>That the Doctrine of Chri≈øt has received its publick Authority from the civil Power, among tho≈øe, who denied Chri≈øt? And what follows: That, if at the time of Chri≈øt, Princes had been Chri≈øtians, they would have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged him for the true God, and the Son of God, ≈øubmitting them≈øelves to his Judgment; ≈øo,</hi>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:60718:98"/>
               <hi>that the Interpretation of the Chri≈øtian Doctrine would have been owing by Chri≈øt, to their Submi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion.</hi> Away with ≈øuch Fictions not agreeable even to common Sen≈øe. He might as well ≈øay, that God's Power over us Mortals did owe its original to the ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion of Princes; and in ca≈øe they thought fit to withdraw them≈øelves from this Obedience, God Almighty (I cannot relate it without horror) mu≈øt thereby be reduced to the Condition of a private Per≈øon.</p>
            <p>In the next A≈ø≈øertion, he is not altogether ≈øo much beyond his Sen≈øes, when he grants, even to Pagan Princes, a Right of determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the controverted Points among Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which is as much as to make a blind Man a competent Judge of the difference of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. When the Primitive Chri≈øtians were forced to appear before the Pagan Judges, it was not on the Account of the Interpretation of the Scripture; The Chri≈øtians could never be guilty of ≈øo gro≈øs an Error, as to Con≈øult with the Unbelieving concerning the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Articles of Faith; But, being forced, again≈øt their will, to appear before them, they could not avoid to receive their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ≈øuch as they were plea≈øed to give, as having no way left them to decline it. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, our Author is plea≈øed to affirm, That ≈øuch an Interpretation ought to be look'd upon as e≈øtabli≈øh'd by Publick Authority, which carries along with it an obliging force, at lea≈øt in outward appearance; ≈øo, that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are obliged to conform them≈øelves to it by a verbal Confe≈ø≈øion, tho' never ≈øo di≈øcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60718:98"/>
from that Opinion, they keep concealed within their hearts. But, the outward Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and verbal Confe≈ø≈øions of a Chri≈øtian, which are not agreeable to the true Sentiments of his Heart, having not the lea≈øt affinity with Religion it ≈øelf, I don't ≈øee, upon what Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count this Chimerical Power is attributed to Princes, unle≈øs it be, to furni≈øh them with a ≈øpecious pretext to afflict their Innocent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Thus much is certain, that Chri≈øt did not command his Doctrine to be propagated by forcible means; ≈øo, that, ≈øuppo≈øing the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, thus e≈øtabli≈øhed by the Civil Authority, to be never ≈øo con≈øonant to Truth, it is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele≈øs incon≈øi≈øtent with the Genius of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian Religion, to impo≈øe them upon Subjects by force, and under ≈øevere Penalties; But, ≈øuppo≈øing them to be fal≈øe, the ca≈øe of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects mu≈øt needs be very mi≈øerable, when they ≈øuffer Puni≈øhment, becau≈øe they will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øs an erroneous or fal≈øe Doctrine. I ≈øee no other benefit to be reap'd from the egregious A≈ø≈øertions of our Author, than to ≈øerve for a Ju≈øtification of the mo≈øt Tyrannical Per≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that have been, and to declare them to have been done by Vertue of a Legal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. At this rate it will be no difficult Task to ju≈øtifie the Proceedings again≈øt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtants in <hi>France,</hi> which move both Pity and Horror in all good Men, at lea≈øt, Mr. <hi>Houtuyn</hi> has very freely offered his Advice and Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage. What follows next, is very ≈ømartly ≈øaid, to wit, <hi>That the Coer≈øive Power may be Legal, whereas the Act of Obedience is not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> No body of common ≈øen≈øe but will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60718:99"/>
that this implies a mo≈øt manife≈øt Contradiction, and, that the Legal Sovereign Authority, and the Obligation of paying O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to it, are in≈øeparable from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Yet with this Nicety Mr. <hi>Houtuyn</hi> is ≈øo mightily taken, that he does not con≈øider, that at the ≈øame time, he grants an ab≈øolute Authority to his Prince, to per≈øecute his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects on the Account of Religion, he takes away from them the Power of denying the true Religion. But, what Rea≈øon can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, why the one ≈øhould have a coer≈øive Power, where the other cannot obey; unle≈øs it be done on purpo≈øe to encourage ambitious and imperious Princes, either to force their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to a ≈øinful compliance, or never to want an Opportunity of afflicting the Innocent at Plea≈øure? For tho≈øe that take to the≈øe violent ways of propagating the Faith, or rather (to ≈øpeak Truth) Hypocri≈øie and Super≈øtition, by their booted Apo≈øtles, are not contented to ≈øilence their Subjects, di≈ø≈øenting from them in Point of Religion, who are al≈øo debarr'd even to ≈øave them≈øelves by flight; (tho' it be no ≈ømall Misfortune to a Subject, to be forced to leave his Native Country) but they compel them to profe≈øs publickly tho≈øe things for Truth, which they abhor in their Hearts, and appear to be Idolatrous, Super≈øtitious, or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitious; invented on purpo≈øe by tho≈øe that make their Market by Religion. Mr. <hi>Houtuyn</hi> him≈øelf cannot but confe≈øs, <hi>That no body can ≈øafely acquie≈øce in any determination made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning an Article of Faith, unle≈øs by his own private Judgment he find it agreeable to the Word</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:60718:99"/>
               <hi>of God. And, if he find it not con≈øonant to that, he ought not to re≈øt ≈øatisfied in it, for fear he ≈øhould di≈øown his Faith, this being the worst, and most unbecoming thing belonging to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian.</hi> But, if it be unbecoming a Chri≈øtian to deny his Faith, which is the ≈øame in effect, <hi>as to rest ≈øatisfied in ones own private Opinion and Con≈øcience, to keep ≈øecret within the heart what one believes, not to indulge ones Tongue, and to refrain from External Actions.</hi> This being the Advice (which in contradiction to him≈øelf, he had not long before given to the Di≈ø≈øenting Subjects) what Rea≈øon can he give for his A≈ø≈øertion, when he attributes to his Prince a Power ≈øo unlimited, that his Chri≈øtian Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects mu≈øt either be forced to undergo ≈øuch an Indignity, or el≈øe the mo≈øt horrible Per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions that can be invented?
